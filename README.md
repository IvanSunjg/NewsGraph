### A Novel Visualization Approach on Robust Facts Inference

LLM's backend part of the work is based on [News Sense](https://github.com/jmilbauer/NewsSense). 

## Project Description 

The exponential proliferation and politicization of news articles pose significant challenges for news readers and journalists in staying informed about real developments ([Benkler et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/book/26406?login=false); [Faris et al., 2017](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/33759251)). While collecting articles on common events, traditional news aggregation engines like [Google News](https://news.google.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en) and [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/) display them in exhaustive lists, necessitating users to individually read and compare each article ([Milbauer et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.39/)). Existing solutions often rely on potentially biased third-party designations or static verified fact corpora that struggle to keep pace with rapidly changing facts ([Bondielli & Marcelloni, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2019.05.035); [Thorne et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/n18-1074)). In response to these challenges, we propose the development of an interactive and intelligent reading interface, NewsGraph, designed to enhance users' engagement with news articles and mitigate inherent biases. Building on the framework of NEWSSENSE ([Milbauer et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.39/)), our interface visualizes results through an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of document collections and detailed claim relations. Users can examine the number and influence of claims within documents and navigate clear links between documents to access corresponding claims.
