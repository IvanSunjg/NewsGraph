He said he would do it in his first term. Now, with immigration a top issue for voters in November, Donald Trump says, if elected again, he's determined to carry out his threat: to round up and deport millions of migrants living in the U.S. without legal permission. To do so, the former president said he would use local law enforcement and the National Guard to find such migrants living across the U.S. He also hasn't ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil or activating the military as part of the effort. \"On Day 1 of my new administration, I will seal the border, stop the invasion of people pouring through our border and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens back home where they belong,\" Trump said at a recent rally in Wildwood, New Jersey. \"They have got to be sent home.\"  It's a proposal immigration experts and advocates say is extreme, and would have major consequences if implemented. \"It's going to be a mess and it's going to be a nightmare,\" David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told ABC News. \"There is no economic or social rationale for it other than a hateful ideology.\" There are about 11 million unauthorized migrants living in the U.S., according to the most recent estimates from the Department of Homeland Security. The overwhelming majority of the population (79%) have been in the country since before 2010, DHS found -- though the report contains numbers through 2022, before the historic influx in border crossings. Data from the immigration advocacy group FWD.us found that 22 million people in the U.S. live in a mixed-status household where at least one undocumented person lives with U.S. citizens, green card holders or other lawful residents. \u201cThese policies will touch every single American,\u201d said Kica Matos, the president of the National Immigration Law Center. \"We're talking about broken communities, families being separated, racial profiling, the trampling of our Constitution, an economic impact -- not to mention the diplomatic and the logistical challenges that this agenda will have on our nation,\" she told ABC News. The National Immigration Law Center challenged previous Trump policies, like those that resulted in family separation at the border and efforts to ban immigrants from Muslim countries and to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Matos said their team has been strategizing since the start of the year in anticipation of a \"possible Trump 2.0\" to challenge any mass deportation plan he may try to enact. The last time there was a mass deportation of migrants in the U.S. was in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who expelled roughly 1 million Mexican undocumented immigrants, many of whom were temporary or seasonal workers, on trains, buses and cargo ships. Trump has pointed to Eisenhower's aggressive actions -- dubbed at the time using the slur \"Operation Wetback\" and later criticized as inhumane -- as a model for his pledge. But in addition to legal roadblocks, any mass removal effort would face huge logistical hurdles: limited detention space, thousands of enforcement personnel needed and heavy case backlogs. \"The overall capacity is nowhere near what would be necessary to carry out the plans as they've been detailed today,\" said Jorge Loweree, the managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council. \"I think people just do not understand how labor intensive this process is, especially in a country of our size and a country of our diversity,\" said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. \"That it's almost impossible to spot an unauthorized worker in the mixed communities that we have and that it takes a lot of personnel resources even to execute a warrant against a single person.\" \"So given all those constraints, people will soon understand that's easier said than done,\" Chishti said. \"It's clearly used for political purposes and we may not hear it again after the election.\"  In fact, Trump similarly pledged a mass deportation of undocumented migrants during his 2016 campaign and it was never carried out. This cycle, Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric against immigrants. He's gone so far as to suggest migrants are \"poisoning the blood of our country\" and, without evidence, to claim they are largely coming from \"prisons, jails, mental institutions, from insane asylums.\" In addition to mass deportations, he's also suggested ending birthright citizenship (a right to citizenship for children born in the U.S. to parents living in the country illegally that is currently guaranteed by the 14th Amendment) and reimposing travel bans. Some observers worry Trump would go further in executing his anti-immigrant agenda if granted another four years as commander in chief. Trump's vowed to expand executive authority and install public servants loyal to him and his vision. And while the courts were a major backstop during his first administration, Trump reshaped the federal judiciary by appointing hundreds of judges and several Supreme Court justices. Plus, it appears he now has more buy-in from Republicans on Capitol Hill. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who was once a champion of immigration reform, recently reversed his stance to support Trump's deportation plan. \"I think they learned some hard lessons in the first term about the agencies and about the courts, and how some of their schemes can be slow walked,\" Leopold said of Trump's team. \"So, I think they will be going into the second term with a lot more knowledge and how to actually run the government and implement their plans.\" 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events", "paragraphs": ["\"It's going to be a mess,\" one immigration expert told ABC News.", "He said he would do it in his first term.", "Now, with immigration a top issue for voters in November, Donald Trump says, if elected again, he's determined to carry out his threat: to round up and deport millions of migrants living in the U.S. without legal permission.", "To do so, the former president said he would use local law enforcement and the National Guard to find such migrants living across the U.S. He also hasn't ruled out building detention camps on U.S. soil or activating the military as part of the effort.", "\"On Day 1 of my new administration, I will seal the border, stop the invasion of people pouring through our border and send Joe Biden's illegal aliens back home where they belong,\" Trump said at a recent rally in Wildwood, New Jersey. \"They have got to be sent home.\"", "", "It's a proposal immigration experts and advocates say is extreme, and would have major consequences if implemented.", "\"It's going to be a mess and it's going to be a nightmare,\" David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told ABC News. \"There is no economic or social rationale for it other than a hateful ideology.\"", "There are about 11 million unauthorized migrants living in the U.S., according to the most recent estimates from the Department of Homeland Security.

She knows there\u2019s a bigger pool of experienced workers out there, but she can\u2019t hire them because they are undocumented immigrants. Winton, who co-founded and runs Winton Machine Company in Suwanee, Georgia, depends on immigrant workers \u2013 about a quarter of her 40 employees were not born in the US. Some have been in the country for many years, and all are authorized to work, she said, noting that she turns away applicants who ask to be paid off the books. Unlike larger competitors, her company is too small to help promising candidates apply for work authorization, which puts her at a disadvantage. That\u2019s why Winton is among the hundreds of business leaders pushing the Biden administration to allow more undocumented immigrants who have been living in the US for years to work legally. Many of them already have jobs, are more connected to their communities and have a better command of English \u2013 making them more desirable employees than recent arrivals, she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to give all these people flowing over the border work permits, let\u2019s focus on the people who\u2019ve been here for a long time, paying into the system,\u201d Winton said. \u201cI need more legal people coming to me for jobs.\u201d Spearheaded by the American Business Immigration Coalition and joined by employers, federal lawmakers, local officials and advocates, the drive is asking President Joe Biden to provide work permits to more long-term undocumented residents, as he has done for certain migrant arrivals. The groups have held multiple news conferences and rallies over the past year to bring attention to the issue. Employers have long sought to help fill their labor needs through immigration reform, but Congress remains gridlocked on the issue. The coalition argues Biden can do more through executive action under current law, including by expanding work permits to spouses of US citizens. Similar actions by Biden and former Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, however, have spurred lawsuits. The coming presidential election is adding urgency to the coalition\u2019s plea. Trump recently told Time magazine that he plans to deport millions of undocumented people if he wins in November. \u200b\u201cPresident Trump will put America and the American worker first,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. \u201cHe will \u200bseal the border, stop the invasion and expand economic opportunity for American citizens, not illegal aliens.\u201d It\u2019s a campaign promise that worries many employers who depend on immigrant workers. With the election only months away, the Biden administration is discussing providing work permits to undocumented spouses of American citizens and legal residents, as well as to certain other immigrants who have lived in the US for many years, according to sources involved in the conversations. Asked about the discussions, a White House spokesperson said that the administration is \u201cconstantly evaluating possible policy options.\u201d \u201cThe administration remains committed to ensuring those who are eligible for relief can receive it quickly and to building an immigration system that is fairer and more humane,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. About 7.8 million unauthorized immigrants were in the labor force in 2021, up slightly from 2019, according to the Pew Research Center. They make up just under 5% of the workforce. Many use fake documents or are paid off the books. Some industries employ a sizeable share of undocumented workers, though exact numbers are hard to come by. About 40% of hired farm crop workers are not legally authorized to work, according to the Labor Department\u2019s National Agricultural Workers Survey, though this could be a significant undercount. One in five undocumented workers are employed in a construction-related sector, according to a Center for American Progress report. A significant number of foreign workers in the dairy industry lack proper documentation, according to the National Milk Producers Federation. Other immigrants have received work permits through various US Citizenship and Immigration Services programs, such as Temporary Protected Status, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and Humanitarian Parole. Asylum-seekers can obtain work permits 180 days after they file for asylum. Mayors in several northern US cities, where migrants are arriving, have pushed the Biden administration to expedite the new arrivals\u2019 work authorizations so they can get jobs and not rely on public assistance. More than 2 million people have work authorization through these USCIS programs, though their status is fluid, according to Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration. Expanding work authorization to more longtime immigrants will make it easier for businesses to fill job openings, as well as bring stability to those who may already employ undocumented workers, said Rebecca Shi, executive director of the American Business Immigration Coalition, which has 1,400 employers, associations and executives as members. \u201cOur employers started asking, \u2018Hey, what about our existing employees? People that have been working on our farm, milking our cows at 3 a.m. for the last 20 years, or people that are designing semiconductors in these fabrication facilities and have very high skills,\u2019\u201d she said. Related article\nThese businesses say they can\u2019t keep up with consumer demand without immigrant workers. Americans just don\u2019t want the jobs Nearly 80% of the nearly 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US in 2022 entered before 2010, according to a recent report from the Department of Homeland Security. With work permits, the immigrants will be able to get better jobs that pay more \u2013 resulting in a boost to federal, state and local tax revenue, Shi said. While it\u2019s easy to understand why both employers and undocumented workers would want to legalize the arrangement, expanding work authorization could hurt Americans, Vaughan said. Instead, she argued, it would be better to lure back the millions of people who have dropped out of the labor force. \u201cIf we could tap this population, we could meet the needs of a lot of these employers,\u201d she said. \u201cCreating a situation where it\u2019s easier for employers to bypass available US workers is going to create other social problems.\u201d Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that he would conduct \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history\u201d if he is reelected. He made similar promises during his first run for the presidency. During his first term, Trump undertook more than 400 executive actions on immigration, according to the Migration Policy Institute. His administration quadrupled the number of worksite investigations and broadened the types of immigrants subject to enforcement actions, including removal. Related ARTICLE\nPromises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term While arrests and deportations of immigrants living in the US increased, they remained \u201cfar short\u201d of the levels seen under Trump\u2019s predecessors, Tara Watson, an economics professor at Williams College, wrote in an EconoFact post in 2021. \u201cRelative to the late Bush and early Obama eras, the Trump administration removed a modest number of immigrants from the nation\u2019s interior,\u201d she wrote. \u201cInstead, the administration increased the visibility and unpredictability of enforcement activity directed at unauthorized individuals living within the U.S. and expanded the use of detention as part of immigration enforcement.\u201d If Trump wins in November, his administration officials would likely be able to quickly ramp up detentions and deportations since they would have experience from his first term, said Kerri Talbot, executive director of the Immigration Hub, an advocacy group that works with Congress and the administration on a pro-immigrant agenda. Trump\u2019s first-term policies had an impact on businesses that rely on immigrant labor. For instance, it was harder for dairy farmers in Indiana to find workers during his first term, said Steve Obert, a fifth-generation farmer in the state and executive director of Indiana Dairy Producers. If Trump wins the 2024 election and carries out his promise, it will hurt farmers, deport taxpayers and break up families, he said. All of Obert\u2019s 15 non-family employees are foreign born and have work permits. But he knows that undocumented workers contribute a lot to the industry, as well as to the communities where they live. He\u2019s advocating for allowing these folks to work legally so they can live without a cloud over them and so that dairy farmers can build experienced, stable workforces to care for their herds. \u201cYou will absolutely cripple the dairy industry in this country if they send these workers back,\u201d Obert said. \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

Tuccille\n\n|\n5.22.2024 7:00 AM With the endorsement of a prominent Republican U.S. senator who was formerly critical of Donald Trump's immigration hawkishness, the Republican party seems wedded this year to a scheme for mass deportation of undocumented migrants. As it embraces the draconian policy, the GOP also attaches itself to the huge price tag inevitably associated with expelling millions of people from the country. The Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille. If you care about government overreach and tangible threats to everyday liberty, this is for you. \u0394 \"If reelected, Donald Trump has said he's willing to build migrant detention camps and deploy the U.S. military to deport the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in this country,\" Kristen Welker asked of Sen. Marco Rubio (R\u2013Fla.) on NBC News's Meet the Press. \"It would be the largest deportation operation in American history. Do you support that plan?\" \"Yes, we are going to have to do something,\" responded Rubio after arguing that the number of undocumented migrants is much higher. \"Unfortunately, we're going to have to do something dramatic to remove people from this country that are here illegally, especially people we know nothing about.\" A son of Cuban immigrants and, at one time, strongly critical of Trump's proposal to end birthright citizenship and otherwise restrict immigration, Rubio's turnaround matches the direction of his party, which takes a hard line on the issue. But if Trump plans \"the largest deportation operation in American history\"\u2014his own words, adopted by Welker\u2014we can assume that such a big-government scheme will come with matching costs. That's exactly what number crunchers predict. \"The costs of the former president's plan to deport the more than 14 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. today could easily reach more than $1 trillion over 10 years, before taking into account the labor costs necessary for such a project or the unforeseen consequences of reducing the labor supply by such drastic amounts over a short period of time,\" MarketWatch's Chris Matthews reported this week of the results of a Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) analysis. Trump's plan is still taking shape, though the former and perhaps future president has proposed using both the military and local law enforcement to eject migrants in this country illegally. If that policy was put into effect, \"the removal of one million immigrants would cost the federal government between $40 billion and $50 billion over 10 years, and up to $100 billion if those immigrants were higher-paid workers,\" Matthews wrote of PWBM's finding. Matthews notes that immigration hawks like Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), predict as many as one million deportations per year under tough enforcement. That's quite a reach, considering that deportations peaked at an average of 383,307 per year under former President Barack Obama. A dramatically higher target means rapidly accumulating costs, with the trillion-dollar price potentially reached after a decade. PWBM's estimate, it should be noted, comes in high relative to some other sources that still name a staggering price for deportation. In 2015, the Center for American Progress, which opposes restrictive immigration policy, calculated that \"a mass deportation strategy would cost an average of $10,070 per person, for a total of $114 billion to remove 11.3 million people.\" Adjusted for Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation figures, that's roughly $153 billion in 2024 dollars. CIS, which takes a hard line on immigration, used a slightly higher per-migrant cost for its estimate, resulting in a total \"cost of deportation of $124.1 billion\" for 11.43 million undocumented migrants based on 2016 numbers. Adjusted for inflation, that's about $164 billion now. The free-market American Action Forum (AAF) predicted in 2015 the federal government would \"need to spend $100 billion to $300 billion arresting and removing all undocumented immigrants residing in the country.\" That's $134 billion to $402 billion now. But AAF warned that border enforcement to prevent further influx of undocumented migrants would cost an additional $315 billion ($422 billion in 2024). CIS offsets the price of deporting millions of people by comparing it to what the organization claims is a \"total lifetime fiscal drain of $746.3 billion\" for the population of undocumented immigrants. But as MarketWatch observes, most experts disagree that undocumented migrants constitute a net drain \u2013 they believe that, on balance, they add to the country's economy. \"Under current law, unauthorized workers\u2026generally do not qualify for federal benefits,\" PWBM economists point in a separate analysis. They add that \"more deportations, though, leads to less economic growth.\" As a result, according to PWBM, with the implementation of restrictive policies, \"GDP in 2050 will be four percent lower relative to no additional deportations.\" AAF predicted that with deportations, \"the labor force would shrink by 6.4 percent and, as a result, in 20 years the U.S. GDP would be almost 6 percent lower than it would be without fully enforcing current law.\" In 2017, the Center for Migrant Studies cautioned that with a mass deportation program, \"gross domestic product (GDP) would be reduced by 1.4 percent in the first year, and cumulative GDP would be reduced by $4.7 trillion over 10 years.\" Obviously, there's a range of costs projected for a policy shift to mass deportations of undocumented migrants. That's because it has never been tried on the scale envisioned by Trump and his supporters. In fact, if Rubio is correct that the real number of people in the country in defiance of the law is \"upwards of 20, 25, maybe 30 million,\" deportations will have to be that much more aggressive, with an even higher price tag to match. That said, Americans consistently name immigration as a leading concern, topping other issues for three months running as of April, according to Gallup. Polling gives Trump the edge on the issue nationally and in key battleground states. \"Trump's policies are described as putting the interests of current U.S. citizens ahead of the interests of recent immigrants, whereas many Arizonans say Mr. Biden's policies don't,\" finds CBS News/YouGov. Still, if Trump and company want to own the issue, the costs associated with it also belong to them. At a time when the federal government is broke, up to a trillion dollars in extra expense may be a hard sell. The Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

{"title": "Trump\u2019s Plans for Mass Deportation Would Be an Economic Disaster | Washington Monthly", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMjMvYnJpZWZpbmcvYWRkcmVzc2luZy1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "text": "Washington Monthly Donald Trump\u2019s fierce enmity towards immigrants is a central theme of his campaign, as it was in 2016. This time, though, he is offering detailed plans that, if carried out, would inflict misery on a mass level and major costs for taxpayers and the economy. Trump\u2019s plans include once again barring entry from selected Muslim-majority countries and, despite the waning threat from COVID-19, denying all asylum claims because a petitioner might carry an infectious disease. Even more radical, the former president promises, if he\u2019s returned to office, to round up millions of unauthorized immigrants, hold them in large detention camps built by the military, and summarily deport them. In a recent interview in Time magazine with Washington Monthly Contributing Editor Eric Cortellessa, Trump said that he is prepared to use the National Guard and the armed forces to execute his plan: \u201cI can see myself using the National Guard and, if necessary, I\u2019d have to go a step further. We have to do whatever we have to do to stop the problem we have.\u201d He justifies all of this with wild claims that other nations are sending patients from insane asylums to the southern border, people akin to Hannibal Lecter, and echoing Adolf Hitler\u2019s attacks on German Jews by warning that immigrants are \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d The program\u2019s alarming dimensions are evident from new data on unauthorized immigrants issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In 2022, 11 million unauthorized or undocumented immigrants lived here, comprising 3.3 percent of the U.S. population. Trump\u2019s dragnet also could end up detaining and deporting 4.4 million children who are U.S. citizens\u2014because at least one of their parents is an unauthorized immigrant. The MAGA attacks on immigration also draw on common fallacies and reckless misrepresentations. For example, the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants have deep ties to their communities and the country, with 79 percent having lived here for at least 12 years and 44 percent for 20 to 40 years. Some also work for businesses, which is the equivalent of 4.5 percent of all employment today. Removing them from the workforce could, at once, bring on a recession while reigniting inflation. Despite the popular misconception that most of these unauthorized immigrants are farm workers, only 4 percent, or 283,000, work in agriculture. Mass deportation would be particularly damaging to the construction industry, which employs 1.5 million or 21 percent of all working unauthorized immigrants, and hospitality companies, which employ 1.1 million or 16 percent. Another 1 million or 14 percent of working unauthorized immigrants have jobs providing professional, scientific, technical, or administrative services; 10 percent or 714,000 work in manufacturing; and 8 percent or 570,000 have jobs in retail. In important part, this reflects unauthorized immigrants\u2019 unrecognized range of educational attainments. While 40 percent did not graduate high school, 27 percent have only high school diplomas, the same share as all U.S. adults. Contrary to their portrayals by Trump and his followers, 14.5 percent have some college or associate degrees, and another 18.5 percent have college or graduate degrees. That\u2019s the same share of college graduates as Black adults in 2006 and Hispanic adults in 2018. By any measure, a policy that eliminated 4.5 percent of the current workforce, including large numbers of college and high school graduates, would set off serious economic tremors. Using Okun\u2019s Law on the relationship between rising unemployment and GDP, a 4.5 percent drop in employment is associated with depressing GDP growth by more than 9 percentage points. This estimate also includes the impact on other jobs. A recent study of much more modest programs to deport immigrants found clear evidence that they cost other American jobs. By one calculation, deporting 1 million immigrants would lead to 88,000 additional employment losses by other Americans, suggesting that Trump\u2019s program could cost up to 968,000 Americans their jobs on top of the 7.1 million jobs held by immigrants up for deportation. The application of Okun\u2019s law to mass deportations is not precise. Nevertheless, it suggests that if Trump\u2019s program were carried out over three years, it would produce a downturn that could approximate the Great Recession in 2009, when GDP fell 2.6 percent and sluggish growth persisted for years. Another gauge of how mass deportations could depress the economy is their direct effects on national wage and salary income. To measure this effect, we start with a landmark study by Harvard economist George Borjas, who found that legal immigrants earned just 4 percent more than their unauthorized counterparts. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median earnings of all foreign-born people working full-time in 2022 was $45,029. Since undocumented immigrants account for 22 percent of foreign-born workers, we can estimate that the median labor income of undocumented immigrants working full time was about $43,300 in 2022. And since wage and salary costs have risen 6.7 percent since 2022, the median labor income of full-time working undocumented immigrants today is about $46,200. Some work part-time, so we also used data on the share of men and women working part-time and the shares of male and female unauthorized immigrants to estimate that 16.6 percent of employed unauthorized immigrants work part-time (nearly 1.2 million) and 83.7 percent work full-time (almost 6 million). Assuming conservatively that part-timers work about 30 hours per week, their median wage and salary income is $34,650. Doing the math, we find that a mass deportation program could depress national wage and salary income by $317.2 billion or 2.7 percent of labor income in 2023. This would be a much larger percentage loss than during the 1980, 1991, and 2002 recessions. It also would be more than half the 5 percent decline in 2009 at the height of the Great Recession. By these measures, too, a severe recession would likely accompany Trump\u2019s draconian program. There would be more costs because a mass deportation program could revive inflation. Labor costs account for about 60 percent of business costs, which increase when companies have to replace large numbers of workers\u2014as happened when restaurants, bars, and hotels reopened after COVID-19 crested. Businesses facing significant labor shortages have three main options: Pay more overtime, pay more to recruit new workers, or live with lower productivity. In all cases, the additional costs are typically passed on through higher prices. While Federal Reserve researchers have found that tight labor markets usually have modest effects on overall inflation, the impact is greater when the tightness is severe and persistent\u2014as it would be if a new administration moved to deport more than 7 million current workers in construction, hospitality, manufacturing, retail, and other industries. On top of these blows, mass deportations would involve enormous costs for taxpayers. One study found that apprehending, detaining, transporting, processing, and finally deporting unauthorized immigrants in 2015 cost the government an average of $18,214 per deportee or $24,094 in current dollars. Using the latest DHS estimates, the taxpayer costs to deport 11 million people would come to $265 billion\u2014without including their American children or the costs to build and maintain large detention camps. For perspective, $265 billion is equivalent to 11 percent of all projected income tax revenues in 2024 and 30 percent of the Pentagon\u2019s 2024 budget. It\u2019s commonplace to call the United States a nation of immigrants. In fact, we now trail at least 40 countries in the foreign-born (legal and unauthorized) share of the population. One reason is the surge of formal deportations following the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001. In the aftermath, George W. Bush\u2019s administration deported about 125,100 people per year, or 1 million in all. Those numbers increased under Barack Obama to 155,300 annually and 1.2 million people over eight years. Remarkably, deportations fell sharply under Trump, averaging 81,400 people annually and 325,000 over four years. President Joe Biden has continued that new trend, with deportations declining to 70,200 annually. Now, Trump seems determined to set new records for deportations, regardless of the costs to taxpayers and the economy. Follow Robert on Twitter @robshapiro. Robert J.

That was my last week in office,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was the lowest number in history.\u201d But Trump was wrong on both points. In fact, the arrow is pointing to apprehensions in April 2020, when apprehensions plummeted during the height of the pandemic. In his last months in office, apprehensions had more than quadrupled from that pandemic low and were higher than the month he took office. Also, April 2020 was not the lowest point in history. The lowest since 2000 came in April 2017, shortly after Trump took office and before an ensuing spike. As we have written, apprehensions at the southwest border, were 14.7% higher in Trump\u2019s final year in office compared with the last full year before he was sworn in. During his speech in Green Bay on April 2, Trump claimed to have \u201cfixed\u201d the border when he was president. \u201cWhen I came in, I built 571 miles of wall, we had 200 miles sitting there waiting to be erected, far more than I said I was going to build,\u201d Trump said. Actually, a total of 458 miles of \u201cborder wall system\u201d was built during the Trump administration, according to a Customs and Border Protection status report on Jan. 22, 2021. Most of that, 373 miles of it, was replacement for primary or secondary fencing that was dilapidated or outdated. In addition, 52 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall were built in locations where there were no barriers before. Including barriers that existed before Trump took office, there are now about 706 miles of barriers, covering about 36% of the total southwest border. That is far less than the 1,000-mile-long wall that Trump promised during the 2016 campaign. Trump then had campaign aides put up a chart showing monthly border apprehensions going back to 2012. You can see the chart in the background of the C-SPAN video, but here it is: \u201cSee that low spot,\u201d Trump said, pointing to the red arrow at the bottom of the chart. \u201cThis is illegal migrants coming into our country. See the arrow on the bottom? That was my last week in office. That was the lowest number in history.\u201d Had President Joe Biden \u201cjust left everything alone, he might have gone down as a decent president, at least on the border,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut on the border, look at that number, that number is so much lower than anything else. And then look at the right of that number. That\u2019s what happened after I left.\u00a0It was an invasion of our country.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing chart actually,\u201d Trump said.  \u201cIt\u2019s a Border Patrol chart. But look at that low number, got it down to practically nothing.\u201d Trump repeated the claim in an April 4 interview with Hugh Hewitt, saying, \u201cWe had the safest border in history, and you saw that chart that was released a couple days ago where literally the day I left office, we had the lowest number in history.\u201d The data in the chart itself are accurate, but the Trump campaign editorial notes are not. The red arrow at the bottom purports to correspond to the point that \u201cTrump leaves office\u201d and to be the \u201clowest illegal immigration in recorded history!\u201d But the arrow actually points to April 2020, when there were 16,182 apprehensions at the southwest border. April 2020 was the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout that month, the U.S. was under Trump administration guidelines recommending people stay at home and away from one another to slow the spread of the disease. \u201cAny complete reading of what took place at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2020 would have to note the emergence of a global pandemic that dramatically chilled mobility of all forms in its early phase,\u201d Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, told us via email. \u201cThat is not a factor listed on the chart below, best I can tell.\u201d \u201cThe pandemic was responsible for a near-complete halt to all forms of global mobility in 2020, due to a combination of border restrictions imposed by countries around the world (we recorded more than 43,000 travel measures taken by countries between January and May 2020 alone, lockdowns, and the shutdown of aviation and other transportation routes),\u201d Mittelstadt said. As the chart shows, after apprehensions reached a pandemic low in April 2020, they rose every month after that. By the actual end of Trump\u2019s presidency, apprehensions of immigrants attempting to cross illegally had risen to 71,141 in December 2020 and to 75,316 in January 2021, Trump\u2019s last month in office. In recent speeches, Trump has claimed he fixed the border so completely during his presidency, that it was no longer a campaign issue in 2020. \u201cI was saying the other day that in 2016, one of the biggest issues was the border,\u201d Trump said during a speech in Ohio on March 16. \u201cAnd I sort of won on the border, I guess, maybe. And we fixed the border. We fixed it so good that I couldn\u2019t even use it in 2020, even though we got millions and millions more votes in 2020, but we couldn\u2019t even talk about it. I\u2019d say, \u2018I want to talk about the border. Tell them what a good job.\u2019 They said, \u2018Sir, you fixed it. Nobody cares.\u2019\u201d In reality, apprehensions at the border in Trump\u2019s final two months in office were substantially higher than in President Barack Obama\u2019s last two months in office. (Apprehensions were 43,251 in December 2016 and 31,576 in January 2017, the last two months of the Obama presidency, compared with 71,141 and 75,316 in Trump\u2019s last two months.) Indeed, there were more than 69,000 apprehensions in each of the last four months of the Trump administration, from October 2020 through January 2021. But the highest number of apprehensions under Obama was 67,342 in March 2009. And as we wrote in \u201cTrump\u2019s Final Numbers,\u201d illegal border crossings, as measured by apprehensions at the southwest border, were 14.7% higher in Trump\u2019s final year in office compared with the last full year of Obama\u2019s term. Given that, had Obama \u201cfixed\u201d the border? Not according to Donald Trump in 2016. Then, he repeatedly called the border \u201cbroken\u201d and made fixing it his primary campaign promise. We have described the roller-coaster of illegal immigration during Trump\u2019s time in office. The number of apprehensions fluctuated wildly from a monthly low of 11,127 in April 2017 shortly after he took office to a high of 132,856 in May 2019. The number of apprehensions peaked for Trump in mid-2019, and the year ended with the highest number of apprehensions since Fiscal Year 2007. In response to rising levels of apprehensions, Trump issued several policies to reduce immigration flows, including measures to restrict eligibility for asylum and return non-Mexican asylum seekers who cross the southwest border to Mexico while their claims work their way through immigration courts (the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program). Correspondingly, apprehensions dropped steadily through the second half of 2019 and into 2020. And then, when the pandemic hit, apprehensions dropped even more dramatically in April and May 2020. In response to the pandemic, Trump put into place a series of policies aimed at blocking migration to the U.S., including one that allowed Border Patrol agents to quickly expel any illegal immigrants they stopped, without allowing them access to the asylum process. Nonetheless, apprehensions increased throughout the second half of 2020. To be sure, illegal immigration soared after Biden took office, as the chart shows even without cherry-picking the pandemic low. According to our latest update to \u201cBiden\u2019s Numbers\u201d in late January, apprehensions for the 12 months ending in November were 296% higher than during Trump\u2019s last year in office. We discussed some of the reasons for that dramatic increase, including not only high levels of migration around the world due to political and economic turmoil in other countries, but also the perception that Biden was more welcoming of migrants. But illegal immigration was not \u201cdown to practically nothing\u201d in the weeks or months before Trump left office. It was down to nearly nothing during the stay-at-home phase of the pandemic.

Q: Is one day isolation sufficient to stop forward transmission of COVID-19? A: People with COVID-19 could potentially transmit it to others well beyond a day after developing symptoms or testing positive. New guidance from the CDC advises people to isolate until they have been fever-free and with symptoms improving for at least 24 hours, and then take precautions for five days, which covers the period when \u201cmost people are still infectious.\u201d", "paragraphs": ["By Robert Farley", "Posted on April 4, 2024", "During a speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin, former President Donald Trump pointed to a chart on apprehensions of people trying to enter the U.S. illegally at the southwest border.", "\u201cSee the arrow on the bottom?

Most of that, 373 miles of it, was replacement for primary or secondary fencing that was dilapidated or outdated. In addition, 52 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall were built in locations where there were no barriers before. Including barriers that existed before Trump took office, there are now about 706 miles of barriers, covering about 36% of the total southwest border. That is far less than the 1,000-mile-long wall that Trump promised during the 2016 campaign.", "Trump then had campaign aides put up a chart showing monthly border apprehensions going back to 2012. You can see the chart in the background of the C-SPAN video, but here it is:", "\u201cSee that low spot,\u201d Trump said, pointing to the red arrow at the bottom of the chart. \u201cThis is illegal migrants coming into our country.

{"title": "How Trump\u2019s first term may have laid the groundwork to make his radical immigration agenda a reality | CNN Politics", "url": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC1uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjQtMDUtMjMvYmlkZW4tdnMtdGhlLWJvcmRlci1ob3ctdGhlLXByZXNpZGVudC1oYXMtaGFuZGxlZC1pbW1pZ3JhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5", "text": "It took Donald Trump one week in the Oval Office to set off an immigration firestorm with the stroke of a pen. The executive order Trump signed in January 2017 was intended to immediately deliver on a campaign pledge to ban entry into the US from certain Muslim-majority nations. Instead, it sparked protests, a series of successful legal challenges, and recriminations from Republican lawmakers and officials alike, who viewed the effort as a half-baked, self-inflicted wound by a new administration quickly being defined by chaos. The backlash and disarray came to define the early months of an administration that lacked the preparation, personnel and legal underpinning to impose swift and severe changes on a complex and bureaucratic immigration system. But in the years since, that initial failure has served to obscure the eventual outcome of a policy that originated as a 2015 campaign press release calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d A revised version of the proposal was later implemented, upheld by the Supreme Court and expanded. The policy dramatically slashed entries into the US and helped reshape how front-line US officials would apply immigration law around the world. As Trump and his advisers map out a potential second-term agenda, the pathway to the implementation and application of the travel ban is a critical window into understanding their ambitions for immigration policy. The anti-immigrant rhetoric that defined Trump\u2019s successful 2016 campaign has darkened and grown even more inflammatory as he seeks a return to the White House. He has framed the current migrant crisis as an \u201cinvasion\u201d by dangerous criminals, who in some cases \u201care not people.\u201d But the focus on Trump\u2019s incendiary language can obscure an expansive and largely unprecedented swath of immigration policy proposals. Related article\nTrump plots mass detention and deportation of undocumented immigrants should he regain power They include mass arrests, detention and deportation. Federal law enforcement would be restructured to direct \u201cmassive portions\u201d of agency personnel toward immigration enforcement. The National Guard would be deployed and, if necessary, US troops as well. Trump\u2019s advisers don\u2019t see their agenda as aspirational political messaging. \u201cThink about the first term, but on steroids,\u201d a former senior Trump administration official who is working outside the campaign to draft immigration policy options for a second term. In interviews with more than a dozen Trump allies, lawmakers and advocates opposed to his immigration positions, there\u2019s consistent agreement on one thing: Trump has every intention of making good on what he\u2019s pledging at campaign rallies. \u201cIt\u2019s important to kind of take him at his word of what he\u2019s promising,\u201d said Todd Schulte, the president of the immigration and criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us, which battled with Trump during his first term. \u201cWhat I do know is that his tools to try and do it will have radically expanded from last time.\u201d Should Trump defeat President Joe Biden in November, advisers and outside allies say they have mapped out a concrete pathway to rapid implementation of that agenda, bolstered by the lessons learned from Trump\u2019s previous stint in office and the steady and systematic weakening of the key forces that hampered those earlier efforts: public opinion, Congress and the courts. Stephen Miller, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers who is expected to run point on immigration in a potential second term, said on a January podcast that their plans would call for \u201can all-of-nation, all-of-government, state, local and federal effort.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a feat similar in size and scale to the other Great American projects that have been undertaken, for example, the transcontinental railroad or digging the Panama Canal,\u201d Miller told podcast host Sebastian Gorka, another onetime Trump adviser who remains close to the former president. The rapid implementation of those proposals would be driven by veterans of Trump\u2019s first term, who would once again be tapped to lead the effort. One Democratic lawmaker who works on immigration issues told CNN that Miller was \u201cthe most dangerous person in Trump\u2019s inner circle.\u201d Asked why, the lawmaker replied: \u201cBecause he has an encyclopedic knowledge of how things actually work.\u201d The plans are neither secret, nor subtle. Instead, they are being shaped by close allies and Trump administration veterans. \u201cOn Day One, we will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump says at every campaign rally. Related article\nTrump explains his militaristic plan to deport 15-20 million people He even cites the precedent his team plans to utilize for the effort \u2013 the deportation initiative undertaken by the Eisenhower administration in 1954. Behind the scenes, advisers are eyeing statutes ranging from the 18th century to the Clinton era to provide the necessary legal underpinning. Draft executive orders have been formulated and would be ready to be revised and deployed at Trump\u2019s request. Key personnel priorities \u2013 particularly for political appointees who wouldn\u2019t need to go through a Senate confirmation process \u2013 have been mapped out to ensure Trump\u2019s plans would be put into motion immediately. Trump White House veterans are keenly aware of career government officials on the front lines who were aligned with and willing to embrace and implement Trump\u2019s hard-line policies. In his campaign speeches, the former president has pledged to dramatically expand ideological screening, use federal law to \u201cdeny entry to all communists and Marxists,\u201d and to revoke the visas of \u201cradical anti-American and antisemitic foreigners\u201d enrolled at US colleges and universities. Refugee and asylum claims, both key targets during Trump\u2019s first term, would once again be sharply curtailed. Temporary work permits would be terminated and Trump has pledged to halt the use of parole authority. The pandemic-era authority known as Title 42, which the Trump administration utilized to implement a de facto shutdown of the southern border, would be reimplemented. Trump, who while in office privately raised the idea of shooting missiles into Mexico to take out \u201cdrug labs,\u201d has campaigned on an explicit war against cartels. The US Navy would be deployed to impose a \u201cfull naval embargo on the cartels,\u201d according to the policy laid out on Trump\u2019s campaign website. The Pentagon would be directed to deploy special forces, cyber warfare \u201cand other covert and overt actions to inflict maximum damage on cartel leadership, infrastructure, and operations.\u201d Related article\nWhite House and Democratic lawmakers plot ways to strengthen their hand on border security The plans would, in many ways, build off the more than 1,000 policy actions taken during Trump\u2019s first term \u2013 all of which the former president and his advisers plan to reenforce. It\u2019s a reality that underscores the overwhelming scale of the immigration effort Trump and his advisers undertook while in office. By the time Trump left the White House, his team had reshaped not just the policy, but every level of a complex interagency process that crosses everything from Customs and Border Protection Border Patrol agents to State Department consular officers. The result was a radically altered immigration paradigm that had been in place for decades under administrations from both parties. \u201cAmericans can expect that immediately upon President Trump\u2019s return to the Oval Office, he will restore all of his prior policies, implement brand new crackdowns that will send shockwaves to all the world\u2019s criminal smugglers, and marshal every federal and state power necessary to institute the largest deportation operation in American history,\u201d Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CNN. Undocumented immigrants who crossed the border since Trump left office, Leavitt added, \u201cshould not get comfortable because very soon they will be going home.\u201d Biden entered the White House pledging to be Trump\u2019s opposite on immigration. Just hours after his inaugural address, he signed a series of executive actions from the Oval Office to swiftly undo key Trump policies in pursuit of what Biden framed as a \u201chumane immigration system that operates consistently with our nation\u2019s values.\u201d On his first day in office, Biden rescinded the former president\u2019s travel ban, along with a series of other Trump immigration policies. But officials cautioned that the process to implement further reforms would take time \u2013 and require congressional action. The lead agencies had been hollowed out in the Trump administration, with a sharp increase in departures from career officials who objected to the policies and chafed under intense White House pressure on their portfolios, multiple Biden administration officials recounted to CNN. The hundreds of executive actions the Trump administration put into place touched every corner of federal authority and were implemented in an interconnected and granular level, the officials said. Three and a half years later, congressional legislative efforts have fallen apart, with Trump playing a central role in torpedoing a bipartisan Senate border compromise in February. Biden\u2019s own executive actions ran headlong into his own thicket of political, legal and policy constraints, driven in no small part by the sheer scale of the overhaul he inherited from Trump. All the while, a series of interlocking migrant crises and cross-cutting political considerations in the wake of the pandemic have elevated immigration to a central electoral issue. Related article\nIn Biden\u2019s pledge to \u2018shut down\u2019 border, a stunning political shift The failed bipartisan Senate proposal captured a dramatic shift on immigration. The White House and Senate Democratic supporters moved firmly behind a proposal that contained no pathway to citizenship or protections for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Republican priorities that in past negotiations would\u2019ve been nonstarters for Democrats had become key selling points. If the long-running border crisis was the driving policy motivation, the enforcement-focused bill was at least partly also driven by new political realities. Biden\u2019s public pledge to devise and implement a \u201chumane\u201d immigration system had given way to a public promise to use emergency authority in the Senate legislation to \u201cshut down the border right now.\u201d There\u2019s also been a sharp rise in the share of Americans who call immigration the most important problem facing the country, and it has topped every other named issue for three consecutive months, Gallup polling found in April. An April CNN poll conducted by SSRS found that 76% of registered voters viewed immigration as extremely or very important to their presidential vote. Trump, in poll after head-to-head poll, holds a significant edge over Biden on the issue. Biden and his allies have pushed to highlight Trump\u2019s role in killing the bipartisan Senate proposal to address the border crisis. In closed-door fundraisers, Biden has also called attention to the radical nature of Trump\u2019s immigration proposals \u2013 something his 2020 campaign used to its advantage. \u201cWe have to be able to control our border, any country does,\u201d Biden said at a May 10 fundraiser in California. \u201cBut the way he talks about it and what he wants to do is criminal. Folks, that\u2019s not who we are. That\u2019s not America.\u201d Still, Trump allies view the shift in public sentiment on immigration as a key political opportunity \u2013 one the former president presses at every opportunity, with a flourish of fear-mongering, hyperbole and outright lies. \u201cThese are people coming out of jails and prisons, they\u2019re coming out of mental institutions, insane asylums,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Michigan earlier this month, repeating a line that remains as devoid of evidence now as it was when he first started using it during the Republican primary. \u201cThese are not people we want, and they\u2019re coming from all over the world.\u201d Trump and his campaign have been unapologetic about the rhetoric \u2013 and have actively looked for ways to draw attention to what they see as a critical advantage. After Trump used the term \u201cbloodbath\u201d during a campaign rally in Ohio in reference to Biden\u2019s electric vehicle policy, the campaign faced blowback over what was perceived as a reference to what would happen in the country if Trump lost the election. Within a day, the Trump campaign had moved to co-opt the term as its own \u2013 and apply it to his immigration proposals in ads and stump speeches. \u201cHe said a lot of that last time so people think he can\u2019t do it this time,\u201d Schulte, of the pro-immigration group FWD.us, said of Trump\u2019s rhetoric and campaign trail immigration promises. \u201cIt feels a bit abstract. It shouldn\u2019t.\u201d The dramatic scale of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda would have a sweeping effect across the US, Schulte said \u2013 one that shouldn\u2019t get lost in debates over his rhetoric. Related article\nTrump has promised an immigration crackdown if reelected. That could backfire on the economy A mass deportation effort would be certain to sharply curtail productivity, Schulte said, given the critical role played by immigrants in the US economy. Federal spending would face a dramatic increase between the deployment of resources, personnel and incentives for state and local authorities to cooperate, he added. Mass deportations would also require the country to grapple with the reality of the US government \u201ctrying to hunt down, round up and deport millions of people here,\u201d Schulte said. \u201cWhat does it mean? What does it look like?\u201d Trump allies say the changing public attitudes on immigration have created space to enact their most aggressive \u2013 and expansive \u2013 policy ambitions at the same moment that the other central roadblocks to Trump\u2019s immigration goals have been dramatically diminished. Once viewed as radical and relegated to the fringes of the GOP, Trump\u2019s immigration agenda is now an animating force for most, if not all, Republicans on Capitol Hill. Trump would also stand to benefit in a second term from one of the cornerstone achievements of his first four years in office: a reshaped federal judiciary. More than 200 current district and appeals court judges were nominated by Trump and confirmed by a Republican-led Senate. \u201cHe\u2019s going to start with a federal bench that has a lot more judges likely to be sympathetic to his arguments,\u201d said CNN Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be especially pronounced in some parts of the country, but it really is a nationwide phenomenon.\u201d Trump\u2019s revised travel ban was upheld in 2018 by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote that served to validate an expansive view of executive authority on immigration. But is also offered the first window into the weight carried by Trump\u2019s nominees to the nation\u2019s highest court after the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch. Trump would go on to nominate two more justices \u2013 Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 who would give conservatives a 6-3 majority, something his advisers regularly point to as they look toward potential second-term legal battles. But veterans of those battles say the strategy is much bigger than the judges themselves. Like so much of what Trump advisers are mapping out for a second term, it\u2019s driven by the lessons learned from the first, including the speed and scale with which they plan to operate. \u201cOne of the other things the Trump folks learned during the first term was that sometimes you win by just flooding the zone,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cFlooding the zone is a big part of the agenda.\u201d \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

It was a big week for immigration politics, but in Wisconsin a reality check shows farmers and immigrant workers have a lot in common | (Getty Images) It was a big week for immigration politics. U.S. Senate Democrats queued up another vote on a doomed bipartisan border security bill, in an effort to expose Republican hypocrisy on the issue. Ahead of the floor vote, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican Sen. Ron Johnson held a press conference Wednesday to denounce the bill, which had Republican backing \u2014 until presidential candidate Donald Trump told members of his party to oppose it so he can continue to use immigration as a cudgel. \u201cWhen you hear Democrats say they want to secure the border, what they really mean is they want to make it more efficient to encounter, process, and disperse illegal immigrants who do not have a valid asylum claim throughout America,\u201d Johnson claimed at his press conference Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s what this bill does.\u201d But back when it seemed likely to pass, immigrant rights advocates were alarmed by the border security bill, crafted after months of negotiations among a bipartisan group of legislators including Arizona independent Kyrsten Sinema and Oklahoma Republican James Lankford. Among the red flags were provisions that expedite deportations, make it harder to qualify for asylum and end the practice of allowing people to stay in the U.S. while they await asylum proceedings. It also adds 5,000 new asylum officers to speed up claims and it beefs up the Border Patrol (whose union backed the bill) and targets money laundering and fentanyl traffickers. Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin held her own press conference Wednesday to speak out in favor of the bill, which she called \u201ca strong measure\u2026 that curbs the flow of fentanyl from coming across our border and expedites the asylum process and boosts border security.\u201d Focusing specifically on overdose deaths in Wisconsin, Baldwin called the bill \u201cdesperately needed.\u201d It\u2019s not \u201cperfect,\u201d Baldwin added, saying she was sad about the omission of protections for Dreamers \u2014 children born outside the U.S. who came here when they were young and know no other home. But, she said to Senate colleagues, \u201cLet\u2019s do something together right now to secure our border to stop the flow of fentanyl, to fix our broken immigration system and to make a real difference for Americans and Wisconsinites.\u201d Making a real difference is not what the vote on this bill is all about, however. Border security is a huge hot button in the 2024 election, courtesy of Trump\u2019s demagoguery. Candidates in each of the two major parties will keep tossing it back and forth until November. Republicans, who got pretty much everything they wanted in the border security compromise, have no intention of voting for it. They\u2019d rather blame President Joe Biden for a broken immigration system that long predates his term in office. Democrats know the bill is going nowhere and are using it to show that Republicans aren\u2019t serious. Meanwhile, back in reality, the same undocumented immigrants who are supposedly such a scourge are propping up the U.S. economy. In Wisconsin, they make up 70% of dairy workers. Last weekend, UW Eau Claire honored dairy farmer John Rosenow, who is an outspoken advocate for the largely Mexican workforce his industry depends on. Because the U.S. offers seasonal visas for agricultural work, but not for the year-round work performed on dairy farms, a majority of workers on Wisconsin dairy farms are undocumented. Rosenow is the rare farmer who is willing to talk openly about this reality. \u201cJohn\u2019s life-guiding philosophy is advocating for those who do not have a voice that is heard here, sharing stories with others and connecting people to one another,\u201d the UW Eau Claire Alumni Association awards committee wrote. \u201cHe keeps an open mind. He\u2019s quiet, soft-spoken, and a man who genuinely listens to opposing views, ponders them as needed, and ultimately is not afraid to evolve as a result if he finds worth in those viewpoints.\u201d Rosenow helped create programs in rural Wisconsin that foster cultural understanding, including Bridges/Puentes, a nonprofit organization that takes dairy farmers to Mexico once a year to visit the families of their workers and see the homes and businesses they are building with the money they earn milking cows. He helped launch a program at UW-Eau Claire that next year will begin placing students on his farm so they get to know immigrant workers. He was also involved in a program that started a mobile clinic staffed by nursing students to serve farm workers. In accepting his award at Eau Claire, Rosenow focused his remarks on an employee named Severo. \u201cSevero came to our farm 25 years ago and started milking cows. He\u2019ll be at the farm tomorrow at 2 a.m. to do it again,\u201d Rosenow said. Severo came to the U.S. because \u201che realized that if he wanted his young family of four boys and three girls to enjoy a life out of poverty, he had to do something drastic. \u2026 For the past 25 years, he has lifted his family out of extreme poverty by sending most of what he earned on my farm back to his family.\u201d Severo\u2019s sons, Juan, Federico and Germ\u00e1n Gildo have all worked on Rosenow\u2019s farm as well, and Severo has built three houses for his family in Mexico with the money he earned milking cows. \u201cI tell this story tonight to offer you a representative of the majority of Mexicans I have had the privilege of working with,\u201d Rosenow said. \u201cI consider them much more deserving of this award than I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s beyond the politics,\u201d Rosenow added when I reached him on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s just human beings trying to make a living.\u201d \u201cIn a politically charged arena of immigration discussion, I try to explain \u2026 how much we have in common with others from a different part of the world,\u201d Rosenow told the awards committee.

Trump's first term in the White House, which ended in 2020, left H-1B visa critics disappointed because he did not deliver major reforms to the employment-based system. Instead, he significantly frustrated the H-1B process, particularly with an uptick in denials and added paperwork to support visa petitions. President Joe Biden, who took office in 2021, reversed some of these actions, making it easier to navigate the visa petition system. But now, Trump is running for president again, and the prospect of his victory in November is alarming to immigration attorneys. They believe that a new Trump administration will be better prepared and ready to take immediate action to curb immigration, including employment-based immigration. \"I expect things will probably get worse a lot more quickly than they did the first time around,\" said Sarah Schroeder, an immigration attorney at DiRaimondo & Schroeder in New York. She said increased barriers and delays in adjudicating high-skilled worker petitions could lead to more requests for evidence, slower processing times and even efforts to block pathways to legal immigration. To prepare for a possible Trump administration, Tahmina Watson of Watson Immigration Law in Seattle said she is \"advising all our clients that if you're eligible for something, file it now. Don't wait.\" Many people believe the Biden administration has created a more favorable climate for visa-sponsoring employers. Still, some this administration's actions might reopen political fractures over employment-based immigration that drove Trump's campaign in 2016. When sponsoring an employment-based green card, employers must make a good-faith effort to advertise for a U.S. worker before filling the position with a foreign worker. However, the Biden administration has proposed adding STEM occupations, possibly including computer engineering and software development, to the U.S. Department of Labor's Schedule A Shortage Occupation List. Jobs on this list are exempt from job advertising requirements. The AFL-CIO, a federation of unions that represents more than 12.5 million workers, opposes expanding Schedule A. In a letter last week responding to a U.S. request for comments about the proposed expansion, the labor group cited AI-based disruptions to the tech workforce and tech layoffs as reasons for its opposition. It also said it \"has watched too many employers claim they cannot find qualified workers only to lay off their employees, including members of our unions, and require them to train their foreign replacements as a condition for their severance.\" Despite Trump's effort as president to frustrate the H-1B system, some things have remained the same. According to the nonprofit Economic Policy Institute, major offshore outsourcing companies, including India-based Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services as well as U.S.-based Cognizant Technology Solutions, remain among the largest users of H-1B visas. Although the denial rate for initial H-1B visas reached a high of 24% in 2018, according to the American Immigration Council, a research group that supports immigration, it fell to 2% in 2022 during the Biden administration. The increased H-1B denial rate and scrutiny during the Trump administration had no effect on the annual visa cap of 85,000, which employers have filled every year. John Miano, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies who has represented tech workers in court over visa issues, said that Trump \"did two things in regard to H-1B that put him way ahead of his predecessors.\" First, he stopped the Tennessee Valley Authority, a federally-owned electric utility company, from turning over 200 IT jobs to contractors; and second, \"he did not make things worse,\" Miano said. The tech industry is expected to continue pushing Congress to expand employment-based visa programs, including the H-1B work visa. It will cite the 2022 $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to revive domestic semiconductor production, as creating demand for workers. Observers expect critics of the industry's efforts to point to tech industry layoffs and the rising number of computer science graduates. In its spring data, the National Student Clearinghouse reported that computer and information science enrollment at four-year institutions reached 629,000 students -- nearly a 10% increase from the prior year on top of a steadily rising trend. When Trump took office in 2016, he slowed the visa system down but only brought about major reforms in the waning months of his administration. He proposed replacing the visa lottery's random distribution system with a salary ranking system, where employers are prioritized based on their salary offerings under the H-1B work visa cap. However, President Biden's administration never enacted the Trump plan. If Trump wins in November, there is reason to believe the administration will try again with a wage-based distribution system. Project 2025, an effort by a long list of conservative groups to set a blueprint for a Trump transition, recommends in its \"Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise\" that the H-1B program \"be transformed into an elite program\" to \"bring in only the top foreign workers at the highest wages so as not to depress American opportunities.\" Marcela Bermudez, an immigration attorney at Greenspoon Marder LLP in New York, said the Trump wage-based plan would disadvantage some companies, especially startups and smaller firms. \"They're not necessarily going to start people at very high wages, but they are talent that we need that will grow,\" she said. Alison Hitz, an immigration attorney at Clark Hill PLC in San Francisco, said it's up to Congress to change the immigration system and that presidents are limited in the changes they can make. However, administrative changes can \"throw a wrench into the processing of cases,\" she said. For instance, premium processing for H-1B visas, which accelerated the handling of the visa, was suspended in 2017 by the Trump administration. In 2020, the Biden administration lifted the suspension. Hitz said a problem with suspending premium processing is that if someone outside the U.S. is waiting for visa approval for a job, an employer might decide that it can't wait six to nine months for the case to be processed and move on. Christopher Richardson, president and general counsel at BDV Solutions, which provides employers help with EB-3 unskilled visa green cards, said that if Trump wins, the visa approval process will \"become a lot harder and probably more expensive.\" \"But,\" he added, \"we've worked through the last Trump administration, and we'll survive and work through this one too.\" Patrick Thibodeau is an editor at large for TechTarget Editorial who covers HCM and ERP technologies.

Despite some successes in changing policies, Mr Biden's wider efforts to reform the country's immigration system have stalled, crushed under the weight of record-breaking numbers of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border. Immigration is now a massive political headache for Mr Biden, as well as a political threat, with more than two-thirds of Americans saying they disapprove of his handling of the border. His predecessor, and potential rival for the White House in November's election, Mr Trump, has seized on the discontent in his current presidential campaign. Mr Biden has been forced to pivot and move closer to the approaches Mr Trump took in office. Let's take a look at the top border issues and where Mr Biden and Mr Trump's policies are different, and similar. Under current law, any foreign national arriving to the US can claim asylum. But both the Biden and Trump administrations have sought to control the number of those making that claim through policies such as the Covid-era Title 42 and the \"Remain in Mexico\" programme. During his successful White House bid, Mr Biden campaigned against Mr Trump's restrictive asylum policies, particularly the \"transit ban\" that forbade migrants from applying for asylum unless they first applied before they reached the US border. Faced with mounting criticism, however, the Biden administration and Democratic allies have suggested asylum provisions similar to Mr Trump's. A stalled bipartisan border bill, for example, would have tightened asylum restrictions and created daily limits on border crossings. Once that capped was reached, asylum seekers would have been turned away. Mr Biden said the bill would have allowed him to \"shut down\" the border when overwhelmed - a drastic change in tone from his campaign. Another Biden administration rule also means that large numbers of migrants are ineligible to claim asylum if they arrive illegally at border points between ports of entry. The Biden and Trump administrations have mostly differed when it comes to parole, where the government allows migrants into the US even if they don't have a visa, or can't qualify for one. While parole authority has existed since the 1950s, it has been used substantially more during the Biden administration, prompting ferocious criticism from Republicans and Mr Trump. This includes the humanitarian parole of migrants who have been detained  - particularly when they are found to have a credible fear of persecution or torture in their home country. There are also special, targeted parole programmes for people of specific nationalities, including Afghans and Ukrainians. As many as 30,000 migrants a a month are able to fly to the US legally on parole under the programme for Cubans, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians, sparking a lawsuit from some Republican-led states who say it is illegal. The scrapped border bill would have kept these programmes in place and allowed parole for those in humanitarian need, but broadly speaking would have restricted its use. When President Biden took office, there was a change of tone and of policy from Mr Trump's administration when it came to deportation, leading to a sharp decline in the number of people being removed from the US. Additionally, the Biden administration swiftly moved to end the arrest and deportation of migrants in the US interior, a sharp departure from the Trump administration's practices. The number of deportations has steadily risen since the beginning of the administration, but experts say that is due to high numbers of arrivals at the border rather than increased enforcement in the US. This has been a key difference between between the two administrations. But the gap may be narrowing slightly, with Mr Biden reportedly mulling executive actions to fast-track deportations for recent arrivals, particularly for those who don't qualify for asylum. Mr Trump, for his part, has vowed to carry out the \"largest deportation operation\" in US history to remove undocumented migrants already in the country if he returns to the White House. He has said he will use the National Guard to carry out his plans, which would come up against legal limits on using US military forces to enforce domestic laws. Building a border wall was a signature policy of Donald Trump as president and was fiercely opposed by Democrats, including Mr Biden, who vowed to not build \"another foot of wall\" when he took office. In October, however, Mr Biden came under fire from both Republicans and Democrats after his administration announced new border wall construction in Texas. Some 20 miles (32km) of barriers will be built in a sparsely populated stretch of the Rio Grande Valley. Mr Biden said he \"had no choice\" because funding for the construction was signed off on while Mr Trump was president. \"I tried to get them to redirect that money. They didn't, they wouldn't,\" Mr Biden said. \"I can't stop that.\" Since then, no announcements about more barriers have come from the Biden administration. Mr Trump, for his part, has continued to tout the construction of border walls at campaign rallies across the US. A poll released by Monmouth University on 27 February found that - for the first time - a majority of Americans support a border wall, with 53% of respondents saying they favour its construction. Thousands of migrant children were separated from their families as part of the Trump administration's \"zero-tolerance\" approach at the border. Mr Trump has hinted that he would take the approach again if re-elected. In November, for example, he told Spanish-language news channel Univision that it had served as a deterrent and \"stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.\" Soon after taking office, Mr Biden moved to end the separations, which he said were reflective of \"the moral and national shame\" of Mr Trump's administration. The Biden administration announced a settlement last October in which family members separated under the previous administration will be given temporary legal and other benefits. The settlement also bans family separations from taking place in the future. Donald Trump held a campaign rally in a diverse New York neighbourhood that is a Democratic stronghold. He previously warned Chinese car makers would \"demolish\" rivals if there were no trade barriers. The US also says it is imposing visa restrictions over the legislation that has triggered mass protests. The demonstration was in support of 13 students barred from graduating after taking part in Gaza campus protests. The sitting US president may be forced to sue to ensure he is on all 50 states' ballots in November. Copyright 2024 BBC.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)               GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump on Saturday further escalated his immigration rhetoric and baselessly accused President Joe Biden of waging a \u201cconspiracy to overthrow the United States of America\u201d as he campaigned ahead of Super Tuesday\u2019s primaries. Trump has a long history of trying to turn attack lines back on his rivals in an attempt to diminish their impact. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to the former president\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his supporters tried to halt the peaceful transition of power. Trump, who has responded by calling Biden \u201cthe real threat to democracy\u201d and alleged without proof that Biden is responsible for the indictments he faces, turned to Biden\u2019s border policies on Saturday, charging that \u201cevery day Joe Biden is giving aid and comfort to foreign enemies of the United States.\u201d \u201cBiden\u2019s conduct on our border is by any definition a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America,\u201d he went on to say in Greensboro, North Carolina. \u201cBiden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations.\u201d Similar arguments have long been made by people who allege Democrats are promoting illegal immigration to weaken the power of white voters \u2014 part of a racist conspiracy, once confined to the far right, claiming there is an intentional push by the U.S. liberal establishment to systematically diminish the influence of white people. What to know about the 2024 Election Trump leaned into the theory again at his rally later in Virginia, saying of the migrants: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to sign them up to get them to vote in the next election.\u201d  \u201cOnce again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement. Trump\u2019s campaign stops came three days before Super Tuesday, with elections in 16 states, including North Carolina and Virginia, where thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered for an evening rally in downtown Richmond. The primaries will be the largest day of voting of the year ahead of November\u2019s general election, which is shaping up as a likely rematch of 2020 between Trump and Biden. Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s last major rival, also campaigned in North Carolina. Speaking to reporters after her event in Raleigh, about 80 miles away, the former U.N. ambassador demurred on her plans after Super Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep going and we\u2019re going to keep pushing,\u201d she said, arguing a majority of Americans don\u2019t want either Biden or Trump as the nation\u2019s leader. Much of Trump\u2019s speech in North Carolina focused on the slew of criminal charges he faces. While the former president has successfully harnessed his legal woes into a powerful rallying cry in the primaries, it is unclear how his message of grievance will resonate with the more moderate voters who will likely decide the general election. \u201cI stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident and a public enemy of a rogue regime,\u201d Trump said, railing against what he called an \u201canti-Democratic machine.\u201d At both rallies, Trump played a recording of \u201cJustice for All,\u201d the version of the Star-Spangled Banner that he collaborated on with a group of defendants jailed over their alleged roles in the January 2021 insurrection, whom he refers to as \u201chostages.\u201d As he focuses on the general election, Trump has painted an apocalyptic vision of the country under Biden, particularly on the topic of immigration, which was the animating issue of his 2016 campaign and which he has once again seized on as the U.S. has experienced a record influx of migrants at the border. Trump and Biden both visited the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday to highlight their contrasting approaches to the issue. On Saturday, Trump conjured images of Biden turning \u201cpublic schools into migrant camps\u201d and \u201cthe USA into a crime-ridden, disease-ridden dumping ground, which is what they\u2019re doing.\u201d He also spoke at length about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student whose alleged killer is a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case. Studies have found native-born U.S. residents are more likely to have been arrested for violent crimes than people in the country illegally, but Trump has seized on several high-profile incidents, including a recent video of a group of migrants brawling with police in Times Square. \u201cNot one more innocent American life should be lost to migrant crime,\u201d Trump said. Trump, who repeatedly attacks Biden\u2019s intelligence and mental acuity, has been sensitive to questions of his own sharpness after he\u2019s mixed up Haley with Nancy Pelosi and Biden with former President Barack Obama at past rallies. Trump has lately sought to inoculate any questions by insisting he interchanges the names intentionally. \u201cI do that because you know that makes a point. Do we understand that, right? Because a lot of people say he\u2019s running the country. I don\u2019t personally think so,\u201d Trump said early into his appearance in Virginia. But more than an hour in to his free-flowing remarks, he seemed to mix up Obama and Biden again, when he said \u201cPutin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he\u2019s starting to throw around the \u2018nuclear\u2019 word.\u201d Beyond their importance on Super Tuesday, North Carolina and Virginia are both states the Trump campaign is focused on for November. Trump won North Carolina twice but watched his margin of victory shrink. Biden\u2019s reelection campaign already has staff on the ground hoping to flip the state for the first time since 2008. Virginia, meanwhile, had once been a swing state but for years has trended blue and Trump lost there twice. But a Trump campaign senior adviser told reporters Saturday that he believes \u201cwe could make Virginia competitive.\u201d In North Carolina, a festive atmosphere surrounded the Greensboro Coliseum Complex ahead of Trump\u2019s rally. Supporters stood in a line that snaked through a web of metal barricades and extended hundreds of yards from the arena. License plates from North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee filled the parking lot, where Trump flags flew alongside U.S. and Confederate flags on many vehicles. \u201cWe just love Trump,\u201d said, Mary Welborn, who lives in nearby Thomasville and expressed that she was frustrated by the criminal prosecutions and civil judgments against the former president. \u201cThe way he\u2019s being treated is insane. No other president has been treated this way,\u201d she said. In Richmond, supporters started lining up Saturday morning for an evening rally at a downtown convention center. The entry lines stretched several blocks by mid-afternoon. Ken Ballos, a retired police officer from nearby Hanover County who said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said he was eager at the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch. \u201cTrump would eat him up,\u201d Ballos said.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "GREENSBORO, North Carolina (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump on Saturday further escalated his immigration rhetoric and baselessly accused President Joe Biden of waging a \u201cconspiracy to overthrow the United States of America\u201d as he campaigned ahead of Super Tuesday\u2019s primaries.", "Trump has a long history of trying to turn attack lines back on his rivals in an attempt to diminish their impact. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to democracy, pointing to the former president\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Those efforts culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as his supporters tried to halt the peaceful transition of power.", "Trump, who has responded by calling Biden \u201cthe real threat to democracy\u201d and alleged without proof that Biden is responsible for the indictments he faces, turned to Biden\u2019s border policies on Saturday, charging that \u201cevery day Joe Biden is giving aid and comfort to foreign enemies of the United States.\u201d", "\u201cBiden\u2019s conduct on our border is by any definition a conspiracy to overthrow the United States of America,\u201d he went on to say in Greensboro, North Carolina. \u201cBiden and his accomplices want to collapse the American system, nullify the will of the actual American voters and establish a new base of power that gives them control for generations.\u201d", "Similar arguments have long been made by people who allege Democrats are promoting illegal immigration to weaken the power of white voters \u2014 part of a racist conspiracy, once confined to the far right, claiming there is an intentional push by the U.S. liberal establishment to systematically diminish the influence of white people.", "What to know about the 2024 Election", "Trump leaned into the theory again at his rally later in Virginia, saying of the migrants: \u201cThey\u2019re trying to sign them up to get them to vote in the next election.\u201d", "", "\u201cOnce again Trump is projecting in an attempt to distract the American people from the fact he killed the fairest and toughest border security bill in decades because he believed it would help his campaign. Sad,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said in a statement.", "Trump\u2019s campaign stops came three days before Super Tuesday, with elections in 16 states, including North Carolina and Virginia, where thousands of enthusiastic supporters gathered for an evening rally in downtown Richmond. The primaries will be the largest day of voting of the year ahead of November\u2019s general election, which is shaping up as a likely rematch of 2020 between Trump and Biden.", "Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s last major rival, also campaigned in North Carolina. Speaking to reporters after her event in Raleigh, about 80 miles away, the former U.N. ambassador demurred on her plans after Super Tuesday.", "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep going and we\u2019re going to keep pushing,\u201d she said, arguing a majority of Americans don\u2019t want either Biden or Trump as the nation\u2019s leader.", "Much of Trump\u2019s speech in North Carolina focused on the slew of criminal charges he faces. While the former president has successfully harnessed his legal woes into a powerful rallying cry in the primaries, it is unclear how his message of grievance will resonate with the more moderate voters who will likely decide the general election.", "\u201cI stand before you today not only as your past and hopefully future president, but as a proud political dissident and a public enemy of a rogue regime,\u201d Trump said, railing against what he called an \u201canti-Democratic machine.\u201d", "At both rallies, Trump played a recording of \u201cJustice for All,\u201d the version of the Star-Spangled Banner that he collaborated on with a group of defendants jailed over their alleged roles in the January 2021 insurrection, whom he refers to as \u201chostages.\u201d", "As he focuses on the general election, Trump has painted an apocalyptic vision of the country under Biden, particularly on the topic of immigration, which was the animating issue of his 2016 campaign and which he has once again seized on as the U.S. has experienced a record influx of migrants at the border.", "Trump and Biden both visited the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday to highlight their contrasting approaches to the issue.", "On Saturday, Trump conjured images of Biden turning \u201cpublic schools into migrant camps\u201d and \u201cthe USA into a crime-ridden, disease-ridden dumping ground, which is what they\u2019re doing.\u201d He also spoke at length about the murder of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student whose alleged killer is a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case.", "Studies have found native-born U.S. residents are more likely to have been arrested for violent crimes than people in the country illegally, but Trump has seized on several high-profile incidents, including a recent video of a group of migrants brawling with police in Times Square.", "\u201cNot one more innocent American life should be lost to migrant crime,\u201d Trump said.", "Trump, who repeatedly attacks Biden\u2019s intelligence and mental acuity, has been sensitive to questions of his own sharpness after he\u2019s mixed up Haley with Nancy Pelosi and Biden with former President Barack Obama at past rallies.", "Trump has lately sought to inoculate any questions by insisting he interchanges the names intentionally.", "\u201cI do that because you know that makes a point. Do we understand that, right? Because a lot of people say he\u2019s running the country. I don\u2019t personally think so,\u201d Trump said early into his appearance in Virginia.", "But more than an hour in to his free-flowing remarks, he seemed to mix up Obama and Biden again, when he said \u201cPutin, you know, has so little respect for Obama that he\u2019s starting to throw around the \u2018nuclear\u2019 word.\u201d", "Beyond their importance on Super Tuesday, North Carolina and Virginia are both states the Trump campaign is focused on for November.", "Trump won North Carolina twice but watched his margin of victory shrink. Biden\u2019s reelection campaign already has staff on the ground hoping to flip the state for the first time since 2008.", "Virginia, meanwhile, had once been a swing state but for years has trended blue and Trump lost there twice. But a Trump campaign senior adviser told reporters Saturday that he believes \u201cwe could make Virginia competitive.\u201d", "In North Carolina, a festive atmosphere surrounded the Greensboro Coliseum Complex ahead of Trump\u2019s rally. Supporters stood in a line that snaked through a web of metal barricades and extended hundreds of yards from the arena. License plates from North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee filled the parking lot, where Trump flags flew alongside U.S. and Confederate flags on many vehicles.", "\u201cWe just love Trump,\u201d said, Mary Welborn, who lives in nearby Thomasville and expressed that she was frustrated by the criminal prosecutions and civil judgments against the former president. \u201cThe way he\u2019s being treated is insane. No other president has been treated this way,\u201d she said.", "In Richmond, supporters started lining up Saturday morning for an evening rally at a downtown convention center. The entry lines stretched several blocks by mid-afternoon.", "Ken Ballos, a retired police officer from nearby Hanover County who said he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, said he was eager at the prospect of a Trump-Biden rematch.", "\u201cTrump would eat him up,\u201d Ballos said.", "Associated Press writers Gary Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina, Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Virginia, and Michelle L.

[+] 2023. If Trump becomes president again, companies should expect new restrictions on employing foreign-born scientists and engineers. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) A second Donald Trump term would bring new restrictions on legal immigration that would affect employers and likely drive more work and tech talent out of the United States. Trump\u2019s actions during his first term, his rhetoric during campaign rallies and statements by allies signal unwelcome news for companies that rely on foreign-born scientists and engineers to grow and innovate. With Donald Trump winning the Iowa Caucus and leading Joe Biden in some polls, employers may wish to include the prospect of a Trump presidency in their contingency plans. If Donald Trump becomes president again, companies should expect new restrictions on employing foreign-born scientists and engineers in H-1B status. After he took office in 2017, Trump\u2019s immigration policies increased the denial rate for H-1B petitions for initial employment (typically new employees counted against the annual H-1B cap) to 24% in FY 2018 and 21% in FY 2019. In 2020, a legal settlement forced U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to end several practices, causing denial rates to plummet to 2% by FY 2022. H-1B petitions for continuing employment rose to 12% in FY 2018 and FY 2019. Those petitions were usually extensions for existing employees at the same company. The denials caused employees who could not obtain extensions to leave the United States. The legal settlement resulted in H-1B petitions for continuing employment to decline to 2% by FY 2022. If Trump officials in a new administration directed USCIS adjudicators to act more restrictively, denial rates would increase. Even successful lawsuits could leave employers with the policies in place for years, which happened after Trump officials restricted H-1B petitions in 2017. In a second term, Trump\u2019s team could return to its H-1B interim final rule published in 2020 (after solving its procedural issues). A lawsuit stopped the rule on procedural grounds. The administration tried to publish parts of the rule again before Donald Trump left office. In October 2020, the Trump administration published two rules to limit H-1B visas for high-skilled professionals and their employers. The Department of Homeland Security rule included restrictive definitions of a specialty occupation and an employer-employee relationship and reduced H-1B approvals to one year for work at customer locations. The Biden administration\u2019s proposed H-1B rule contains a restriction on specialty occupations identical to a measure in the Trump 2020 interim final rule. That would give Trump officials a head start. The Trump and Biden H-1B rules narrowed which positions are specialty occupations by using the phrase \u201cdirectly related specific specialty.\u201d According to the rules, to be considered a specialty occupation, the position must require \u201cA U.S. baccalaureate or higher degree in a directly related specific specialty or its equivalent\u201d to enter the occupation. Trump administration officials likely hoped to deal a death blow to companies employing H-1B visa holders who perform work at customer sites. In January 2021, the Trump administration posted a scaled-down version of the October 2020 interim final rule and focused on the term \u201cemployer-employee relationship.\u201d The administration posted online (but did not publish in the Federal Register) its \u201cfinal rule\u201d in mid-January. It informed the public the rule should be read in combination with a Department of Labor memo issued on January 15, 2021. \u201cThe new DHS rule significantly changes the definition of an employer to allow DHS to require the customers of information technology and professional services companies to submit labor condition applications and H-1B petitions as if they were employers of the H-1B professionals, which they are not,\u201d according to a Forbes article. The goal was to make it untenable for companies to send H-1B employees to customer sites. \u201cThese additional requirements would likely drive customers away from any IT services companies that send H-1B visa holders to a customer\u2019s location since few customers want to (or can) take on legal obligations for individuals for whom they do not possess the ability to hire, fire or compensate,\u201d the article noted. The combination of the DHS rule and the DOL memo might have been unlawful. However, the issue became moot since DHS did not publish its revised H-1B rule before Donald Trump left office. In October 2020, the Trump Department of Labor published a separate interim final rule designed to price most H-1B visa holders out of the U.S. labor market by significantly increasing the required minimum wage. \u201cUnder the new DOL mandated minimum salary, an employer in the San Jose, California area would pay an electrical engineer at Level 4 nearly $85,000 (or 53%) above the market wage, as indicated by a private wage survey, and 54% above the market wage . . . at Level 1,\u201d according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. Research shows H-1B restrictions lead to companies sending more jobs, resources and innovations outside the United States. \u201cWhen U.S. firms are denied H-1Bs, they go abroad, setting up new foreign affiliates and hiring talent there instead of in the U.S.,\u201d according to Britta Glennon, an assistant professor at the Wharton School at UPenn. \u201cFor most global multinational companies, this is at almost a 1:1 rate. The results demonstrate an important unintended consequence of immigration restrictions: the movement of jobs and talent abroad, with major implications for U.S. competitiveness.\u201d The Supreme Court is expected to rule this term on Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo. Both cases involve Chevron deference, which has granted significant leeway to federal agency interpretations of the law. Ironically, if Trump-appointed justices on the Supreme Court vote to limit Chevron deference, it could provide employers and others with greater legal recourse against highly restrictive immigration regulations drafted by Trump officials in a second term. As president, Donald Trump extensively used the authority in 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the entry of immigrants and temporary visa holders. In April 2020, Trump used section 212(f) to issue a proclamation that suspended the entry of immigrants, including employment-based immigrants. Only the spouses and children of U.S. citizens were exempted. In June 2020, Trump used his authority to issue a separate proclamation to suspend the entry of H-1B, L-1 and other temporary visa holders. A court ruled the proclamation exceeded the president\u2019s authority, but the ruling did not have a significant practical impact because Covid-19 limited visa processing at U.S. consulates. The 212(f) proclamations did not prevent employment-based immigrants from adjusting their status inside the United States, which the vast majority do, or stop H-1B visa holders who remained in America and changed status from F-1 student. However, such proclamations could block future H-1B and L-1 visa holders from entering the United States. In Trump v. Hawaii, the Supreme Court gave wide latitude to the president\u2019s use of 212(f), ruling the ban on the entry of individuals from several primarily Muslim countries did not exceed the president\u2019s authority. If Donald Trump wins the 2024 presidential election, employers should expect policies restricting H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants. They should also anticipate other policies, such as banning the entry of immigrants and temporary visa holders from many Muslim-majority countries. Company contingency plans focused on moving talent and resources outside the United States may accelerate as November 2024 approaches.  One Community.

Jeff Aznavorian, the company president, thought he might enjoy some relief once Joe Biden entered the White House. Instead, Biden largely preserved Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 on steel, aluminum and a mass of goods from China. \u201cIt was a little surprising that an ideologically different administration would keep the policies so intact,\u2019\u2019 Aznavorian said, recalling how a previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, had fought for freer trade. \u201cThat\u2019s just so different from a 2024 Biden administration.\u2019\u2019 Trump and Biden agree on essentially nothing, from taxes and climate change to immigration and regulation. Yet on trade policy, the two presumptive presidential nominees have embraced surprisingly similar approaches. Which means that whether Biden or Trump wins the presidency, the United States seems poised to maintain a protectionist trade policy \u2014 a policy that experts say could feed inflation pressures. Last week, in fact, Biden announced some new tariffs, on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells and other products, that he said would keep Beijing from flooding the United States with cheap imports. The protectionist tilt of the two presidential contenders reflects the widespread view that opening the nation to more imports \u2014 especially from China \u2014 wiped out American manufacturing jobs and shuttered factories. It's an especially potent political topic in the Midwestern industrial states that will likely decide who wins the White House. \u201cIf you look at the election, it\u2019s obvious,\u2019\u2019 said William Reinsch, a former trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWhere are the deciding states? Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin \u2014 right there, you can see that trade is going to have an outsize role.\u2019\u2019 In their own ways, the two candidates have ditched a U.S. commitment to relatively frictionless trade \u2014 low barriers and scant government interference \u2014 that were a bedrock of American policy for decades after World War II. The idea was that free trade would hold down costs and aid consumers and businesses across the world. In recent years, though, the perception grew that while free trade benefited households and companies, it hurt workers, with American jobs falling victim to cheaper foreign labor. \u201cThe once nearly unanimous Washington consensus on free trade is dead,\" Robert Lighthizer, who was Trump\u2019s lead trade negotiator, crowed in his 2023 book, \u201cNo Trade Is Free.\u2019\u2019 Yet like free trade, trade protectionism carries its own economic price. It can raise costs for households and businesses just as the nation is struggling to fully tame inflation. It tends to prop up inefficient companies. It spurs retaliation from other nations against American exporters. And it typically sours relations with allies and adversaries alike. Trump, who brazenly labeled himself \u201cTariff Man,\u2019\u2019 tried to pummel America's trading partners with import taxes, vowing to shrink America\u2019s trade deficits, especially with China. He did pressure Mexico and Canada into rewriting a North American trade deal that Trump insisted had destroyed U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also persuaded China to agree to buy more American farm goods. But his efforts didn't revive the manufacturing base \u2014 factory jobs make up a smaller share of U.S. employment than they did before his presidency \u2014 or shrink America's trade deficits. Trump has vowed more of the same in a second term. He's threatening to impose a 10% tariff on all imports \u2014 and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. \u201cI call it a ring around the country,\u2019\u2019 Trump said in an interview with Time magazine. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, warns that the consequences would be damaging. Trump\u2019s tariff plans, Zandi said, \u201cwould spark higher inflation, reduce GDP and jobs and increase unemployment, all else equal.\" A year after the import taxes were imposed, Zandi estimates, average consumer prices would be 0.7 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be. A report out Monday, from Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that for families in the middle of the U.S. income distribution, Trump's tariff proposals would amount to a tax of at least $1,700 a year. For his part, Biden favors subsidizing such key industries as chipmaking and EV manufacturing to give them a competitive edge. It's a stance that reflects worry that China's rising military and technological might imperils America's national security. As last week's announcement showed, Biden isn't averse to new tariffs, either. His top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, has opened an investigation into Chinese trade practices in the shipbuilding industry, likely a prelude to imposing further sanctions on Beijing. \u201cThe laissez-faire economic model of trade wasn\u2019t working for the United States,\u2019\u2019 said Elizabeth Baltzan, a senior adviser to Tai. \u201cWe want to correct for that. The measures you take in order to get a fairer (economy) may involve measures that could be labeled protectionist. But I think you have to ask what you\u2019re protecting\" \u2014 notably working-class communities. Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist who was an early critic of the globalization of the 1990s and 2000s, views Biden trade policies more favorably than he does Trump\u2019s approach. \u201cTrump\u2019s was knee-jerk and incoherent; there is little evidence that his trade restrictions on China did any good to workers or the middle class in the U.S.,\u2019\u2019 Rodrik said. By contrast, he said, \u201cBiden\u2019s approach is strategic and based on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing capacity and investing in the green transition, so fundamentally strengthening the U.S. economy rather than crass protectionism.\u201d Either way, a consensus formed in recent years that U.S. trade policy had to change. Moving factories to low-wage countries like Mexico and China in the 1990s and early 2000s, critics say, fattened corporate profits and enriched executives and investors but devastated American factory towns that couldn\u2019t compete with cheap imports. David Autor, a leading economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two colleagues concluded in a 2016 paper that from 1999 to 2011, cheap Chinese imports wiped out 2.4 million American jobs. More recently, China\u2019s rise as America\u2019s No. 1 geopolitical rival has created a bipartisan effort to reduce America's reliance on Beijing for supplies of everything from pharmaceuticals to \u201crare earth\u2019\u2019 minerals for electric cars and cellphones. Though this sea change in policy may have started with Trump, discontent with free trade and with an increasingly combative China had been building for years. One of Trump\u2019s first presidential acts was to dump a free trade agreement the Obama administration had negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim countries. Then Trump really got going. He imposed taxes on foreign washing machines and solar panels. Next, he labeled steel and aluminum imports a threat to national security and hit them with tariffs. Finally, he started perhaps the biggest trade war since the 1930s: He hammered $360 billion of Chinese products with tariffs for Beijing\u2019s efforts to surpass U.S. technological supremacy through illicit tactics, including cybertheft. China lashed back with retaliatory taxes of its own: It targeted American farmers, in particular, to try to hurt Trump\u2019s constituency in rural America. Did Trump\u2019s tariff war achieve anything? A study by Autor and colleagues at the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump\u2019s import taxes failed in their goal to return jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs, the study found, \u201cneither raised nor lowered U.S. employment\u2019\u2019 where they were supposed to protect jobs. Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \u201cnegative employment impacts,\u2019\u2019 especially for farmers. These were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump bestowed on farmers to cushion their pain. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on supplies that were affected by the tariffs. In Plymouth, Michigan, Clips & Clamps doesn\u2019t even use much imported steel. Yet it was still hurt by the tariffs because they allowed American steel producers to raise their prices. \u201cOur raw material prices here in the United States tend to be 20% higher than Europe and Mexico and 40% to 60% higher than China,\u2019\u2019 Aznavorian said. His overseas rivals, he said, enjoy \u201csignificantly cheaper\u2019\u2019 costs. If Trump\u2019s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. Autor\u2019s study found that support for Trump and Republicans running for Congress rose in the areas most exposed to the import tariffs \u2014 the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee. After entering office, Biden retained many of Trump\u2019s trade policies and made no effort to revive Obama\u2019s old Pacific Rim trade pact. He kept Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, while letting some trading partners avoid it until they reached a quota. He also retained China tariffs. Biden even turned up the heat on Beijing by restricting its access to advanced computer chips and the equipment to make them. \u201cTrade and national security have been combined into one thing,\u2019\u2019 Reinsch said. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve had an adversary that posed both an economic and a security challenge. The Soviet Union was a security challenge, but it was never an economic threat. Japan was an economic threat in the \u201980s, but it was never a security threat; they were an ally. China is both, and it\u2019s been complicated trying to figure out how to deal with that.\u2019\u2019 Biden\u2019s China policies are \u201cgrounded in national security,\u2019\u2019 said Peterson's Lovely. \u201cThat makes it harder to critique because national security is always this black box that only those with the highest security clearance get to see.\u2019\u2019 The Biden administration has rankled some U.S. allies by offering subsidies to encourage U.S. companies to manufacture goods in America. Under Biden\u2019s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, auto buyers can receive a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle. But the credit applies only to EVs assembled in North America. And the full credit goes only to EVs in which at least 60% of battery parts are made in North America and 50% of the \u201ccritical minerals\u2019\u2019 used in the vehicle \u2014 like cobalt, copper and lithium \u2014 come from the United States or a country with which the U.S. has a free trade deal. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the United States develop its own clean energy sector, in collaboration with its allies and partners, thereby not becoming dependent on Chinese technologies,'' said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator who is vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cWhen trade is increasingly being weaponized, it\u2019s important that the U.S. does not become overly dependent on China for strategic products.\u2019\u2019 Biden\u2019s initiatives \u2014 including incentives to produce green technology and computer chips in the United States \u2014 have spurred what looks like a surge of investment in manufacturing. Karen Dynan of the Peterson Institute has reported that investment in U.S. factories surged at an 80% annual rate in the January-March period compared with the final three months of 2023, helping fuel the economy\u2019s unexpectedly strong performance. The United States seems unlikely to reverse its tilt toward protectionism anytime soon. China, struggling to revive its own economy, is trying to export its way out of trouble, threatening to overwhelm world markets with cheap EVs and other products. As for Aznavorian, he hopes the U.S. mends trade relations with its allies. \u201cWe need friendly trade partners in order to compete against China,\u2019\u2019 he said. Yet when it comes to China and other U.S. adversaries, Aznavorian said, he\u2019s convinced that protectionist trade policies are \u201cdefinitely here to stay.\u2019\u2019 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events", "paragraphs": ["President Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on essentially nothing, from taxes and climate change to immigration and regulation", "WASHINGTON -- As president, Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on foreign steel, which hurt Clips & Clamps Industries, a Michigan auto supplier \u2014 raising its materials prices, making it harder to compete with overseas rivals and costing it several contracts.", "Jeff Aznavorian, the company president, thought he might enjoy some relief once Joe Biden entered the White House. Instead, Biden largely preserved Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 on steel, aluminum and a mass of goods from China.", "\u201cIt was a little surprising that an ideologically different administration would keep the policies so intact,\u2019\u2019 Aznavorian said, recalling how a previous Democratic president, Bill Clinton, had fought for freer trade. \u201cThat\u2019s just so different from a 2024 Biden administration.\u2019\u2019", "Trump and Biden agree on essentially nothing, from taxes and climate change to immigration and regulation. Yet on trade policy, the two presumptive presidential nominees have embraced surprisingly similar approaches. Which means that whether Biden or Trump wins the presidency, the United States seems poised to maintain a protectionist trade policy \u2014 a policy that experts say could feed inflation pressures.", "Last week, in fact, Biden announced some new tariffs, on Chinese electric vehicles, advanced batteries, solar cells and other products, that he said would keep Beijing from flooding the United States with cheap imports.", "The protectionist tilt of the two presidential contenders reflects the widespread view that opening the nation to more imports \u2014 especially from China \u2014 wiped out American manufacturing jobs and shuttered factories. It's an especially potent political topic in the Midwestern industrial states that will likely decide who wins the White House.", "\u201cIf you look at the election, it\u2019s obvious,\u2019\u2019 said William Reinsch, a former trade official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cWhere are the deciding states? Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin \u2014 right there, you can see that trade is going to have an outsize role.\u2019\u2019", "In their own ways, the two candidates have ditched a U.S. commitment to relatively frictionless trade \u2014 low barriers and scant government interference \u2014 that were a bedrock of American policy for decades after World War II. The idea was that free trade would hold down costs and aid consumers and businesses across the world.", "In recent years, though, the perception grew that while free trade benefited households and companies, it hurt workers, with American jobs falling victim to cheaper foreign labor.", "\u201cThe once nearly unanimous Washington consensus on free trade is dead,\" Robert Lighthizer, who was Trump\u2019s lead trade negotiator, crowed in his 2023 book, \u201cNo Trade Is Free.\u2019\u2019", "Yet like free trade, trade protectionism carries its own economic price. It can raise costs for households and businesses just as the nation is struggling to fully tame inflation. It tends to prop up inefficient companies. It spurs retaliation from other nations against American exporters. And it typically sours relations with allies and adversaries alike.", "Trump, who brazenly labeled himself \u201cTariff Man,\u2019\u2019 tried to pummel America's trading partners with import taxes, vowing to shrink America\u2019s trade deficits, especially with China.", "He did pressure Mexico and Canada into rewriting a North American trade deal that Trump insisted had destroyed U.S. manufacturing jobs. He also persuaded China to agree to buy more American farm goods. But his efforts didn't revive the manufacturing base \u2014 factory jobs make up a smaller share of U.S. employment than they did before his presidency \u2014 or shrink America's trade deficits.", "Trump has vowed more of the same in a second term. He's threatening to impose a 10% tariff on all imports \u2014 and a 60% tax on Chinese goods.", "\u201cI call it a ring around the country,\u2019\u2019 Trump said in an interview with Time magazine.", "Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, warns that the consequences would be damaging. Trump\u2019s tariff plans, Zandi said, \u201cwould spark higher inflation, reduce GDP and jobs and increase unemployment, all else equal.\"", "A year after the import taxes were imposed, Zandi estimates, average consumer prices would be 0.7 percentage points higher than they would otherwise be. A report out Monday, from Kimberly Clausing and Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, estimates that for families in the middle of the U.S. income distribution, Trump's tariff proposals would amount to a tax of at least $1,700 a year.", "For his part, Biden favors subsidizing such key industries as chipmaking and EV manufacturing to give them a competitive edge. It's a stance that reflects worry that China's rising military and technological might imperils America's national security. As last week's announcement showed, Biden isn't averse to new tariffs, either. His top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, has opened an investigation into Chinese trade practices in the shipbuilding industry, likely a prelude to imposing further sanctions on Beijing.", "\u201cThe laissez-faire economic model of trade wasn\u2019t working for the United States,\u2019\u2019 said Elizabeth Baltzan, a senior adviser to Tai. \u201cWe want to correct for that. The measures you take in order to get a fairer (economy) may involve measures that could be labeled protectionist. But I think you have to ask what you\u2019re protecting\" \u2014 notably working-class communities.", "Dani Rodrik, a Harvard economist who was an early critic of the globalization of the 1990s and 2000s, views Biden trade policies more favorably than he does Trump\u2019s approach.", "\u201cTrump\u2019s was knee-jerk and incoherent; there is little evidence that his trade restrictions on China did any good to workers or the middle class in the U.S.,\u2019\u2019 Rodrik said.", "By contrast, he said, \u201cBiden\u2019s approach is strategic and based on rebuilding U.S. manufacturing capacity and investing in the green transition, so fundamentally strengthening the U.S. economy rather than crass protectionism.\u201d", "Either way, a consensus formed in recent years that U.S. trade policy had to change. Moving factories to low-wage countries like Mexico and China in the 1990s and early 2000s, critics say, fattened corporate profits and enriched executives and investors but devastated American factory towns that couldn\u2019t compete with cheap imports.", "David Autor, a leading economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two colleagues concluded in a 2016 paper that from 1999 to 2011, cheap Chinese imports wiped out 2.4 million American jobs.", "More recently, China\u2019s rise as America\u2019s No. 1 geopolitical rival has created a bipartisan effort to reduce America's reliance on Beijing for supplies of everything from pharmaceuticals to \u201crare earth\u2019\u2019 minerals for electric cars and cellphones.", "Though this sea change in policy may have started with Trump, discontent with free trade and with an increasingly combative China had been building for years. One of Trump\u2019s first presidential acts was to dump a free trade agreement the Obama administration had negotiated with 11 Pacific Rim countries.", "Then Trump really got going. He imposed taxes on foreign washing machines and solar panels. Next, he labeled steel and aluminum imports a threat to national security and hit them with tariffs.", "Finally, he started perhaps the biggest trade war since the 1930s: He hammered $360 billion of Chinese products with tariffs for Beijing\u2019s efforts to surpass U.S. technological supremacy through illicit tactics, including cybertheft. China lashed back with retaliatory taxes of its own: It targeted American farmers, in particular, to try to hurt Trump\u2019s constituency in rural America.", "Did Trump\u2019s tariff war achieve anything?", "A study by Autor and colleagues at the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump\u2019s import taxes failed in their goal to return jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs, the study found, \u201cneither raised nor lowered U.S. employment\u2019\u2019 where they were supposed to protect jobs.", "Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had \u201cnegative employment impacts,\u2019\u2019 especially for farmers. These were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump bestowed on farmers to cushion their pain.", "The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on supplies that were affected by the tariffs.

Trump recently told Time that he would aim to deport 15 million to 20 million people, perhaps by using the National Guard. Some economists worry that Trump\u2019s proposed immigration crackdown \u2014 if it survived legal challenges \u2014 would backfire on the US economy by worsening worker shortages, reigniting inflation and forcing the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing costs high for even longer. \u201cIf he follows through in deporting a significant amount of immigrants, that\u2019s going to be very difficult for businesses,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause them to raise wages and prices.\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said the problem is that the supply of native-born workers simply cannot meet demand. \u201cWe need to import workers,\u201d Brusuelas said. \u201cIf either party oversteps in reducing the flow of workers, it\u2019s likely we would face a serious shortage of workers and a renewed bout of inflation. You would drive the unemployment rate down to 3% and wages would pop. You\u2019d get classic inflation.\u201d And that would have serious implications for the Fed, which has already warned that interest rates will need to stay high for longer than anticipated to fight stubborn inflation. \u201cIn that case, higher for longer has a much different meaning,\u201d said Brusuelas. In a statement to CNN, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt argued, without evidence, that President Joe Biden \u201callowed\u201d undocumented immigrants to \u201cinvade our border\u201d and that if he\u2019s reelected they will be allowed to stay. \u201cMedicare, Social Security, the healthcare system, public safety and American democracy itself will buckle and collapse,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cWhen President\u00a0Trump\u00a0is back in the White House, he will deport the millions of illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in and reimplement his America First, pro-growth, pro-job agenda to uplift all Americans.\u201d Inflation remains a major concern for Americans. Even though consumer prices are no longer skyrocketing, the cumulative impact of three years of high inflation is painful. Americans are paying much more for housing, food and car insurance than they were before Covid-19. Frustrations with the high cost of living helped drive down consumer sentiment to a six-month low, the University of Michigan survey of consumers found on Friday. \u201cMost Americans view high inflation and high prices as unfair. It\u2019s a rip-off. How is it possible I\u2019m paying more for something \u2013 a lot more for something \u2013 today than three years ago?\u201d said Zandi. Anger over inflation could help return Trump to the White House. And yet, ironically, economists warn that his immigration plan \u2013 and his vow to impose massive tariffs on China and other nations \u2013 could worsen that same inflation problem. \u201cMy sense is President Trump\u2019s policies are inflationary,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt\u2019s higher tariffs, it\u2019s more deportations. \u2026 I think these things are going to lead to higher prices for American consumers.\u201d Some businesses continue to face a shortage of workers. Although the number of job openings has tumbled in recent months, it remains well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Labor Department. Of course, it\u2019s hard to know whether Trump would carry through on his immigration proposals. After all, he promised mass deportations in 2016, too. And Trump\u2019s immigration plans would surely face serious legal challenges. But immigration remains a major concern for voters in the 2024 election and Trump has made it a centerpiece of his campaign. The spike in immigration over the last several years has caused a severe strain on resources in some cities and states as officials scramble to house, educate and feed asylum seekers. And the flow of migrants, along with a series of high-profile criminal cases involving migrants, have contributed to concerns about crime \u2014 though criminologists are skeptical about the connection. Even the Biden administration has tried to take a tougher position on immigration. Last week, US officials proposed a rule that would let immigration authorities rapidly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum. Yet economists say the immigration spike has also played a major role in one of the big positive surprises of the past few years: America\u2019s ability to defy recession forecasts. To the shock of many forecasters, the post-Covid labor market has not run out of workers. Jobs growth continues at a pace few thought possible. And the unemployment rate has stayed under 4% for 27 months in a row, matching the record streak from 1967 to 1970. Economists say the recent spike in immigration helped make these surprises possible, by preventing the jobs market from totally overheating and the Fed from overdoing rate hikes. \u201cIt helped to ease the very tight labor market, bring in some of those wage pressures and reduce inflation,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt also allowed the economy to grow more quickly.\u201d Prior to Covid-19, population and labor force projections from the federal government suggested the US economy would only be able to sustainably add (without worsening inflation) between 60,000 and 140,000 jobs per month and then between 60,000 and 100,000 per month by 2024, according to research from The Hamilton Project. In reality, the US economy added an average of 255,000 jobs per month in 2023 \u2014 two to four times the pace considered sustainable, research notes. \u201cJust in the last year, a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in February. The Hamilton Project paper estimates sustainable employment growth will be between 160,000 and 200,000 per month in 2024 \u2014 about double what would have been possible before the immigration surge. Without that influx of workers, the US economy could have faced a different fate. \u201cThe Fed would have likely overdone it with rates and tipped the economy into recession,\u201d said Brusuelas, the RSM economist. Immigration collapsed when the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020, contributing to the historic shortage of workers that drove up wages. But then immigration rebounded massively in 2022 and 2023, in part because of a surge of migrants. US authorities had more than 2.5 million encounters with migrants crossing the US-Mexico border last year alone, according to Homeland Security estimates. In 2023, the United States experienced net immigration of about 3.3 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That well exceeds the average of just 900,000 that was typical between 2010 and 2019. The immigration spike has been so significant that the CBO estimates the United States is on track to have 1.7 million more people in its pool of workers this year compared with what was expected last year. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that the immigration surge eased wage growth by 0.3 percentage points at the national level and by at least twice as much in the low-paying leisure and hospitality sector. Although the \u201ctextbook answer\u201d is that immigration should not matter much for wages and inflation, Goldman Sachs economists recently told clients: \u201cWe think this time was a bit different.\u201d \u201cThe main reasons are that the immigration turnaround was very large and that it occurred at a time when the labor market was historically overheated,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote. Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs said \u201cmoderate fluctuations\u201d in immigration will probably have \u201clittle impact\u201d on wage growth and inflation. The exception, the bank said, would be in the event of \u201cdramatic policy changes.\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project and senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told CNN she is \u201cconfident\u201d an immigration crackdown like the one Trump proposes would have \u201cnegative\u201d effects on the economy. However, Edelberg is less concerned about the inflationary impact and more worried about a crash in demand \u2014 especially in communities that have experienced a large influx of immigrants. She noted that some businesses have enjoyed a sharp increase in demand in recent years in large part because of immigrants. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that could spark a recession,\u201d Edelberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to suggest this would be a cataclysmic recession, but this would be a very abrupt reduction in aggregate demand. Generally, that\u2019s not the kind of thing that our economy likes.\u201d CNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

You\u2019d get classic inflation.\u201d", "And that would have serious implications for the Fed, which has already warned that interest rates will need to stay high for longer than anticipated to fight stubborn inflation.", "\u201cIn that case, higher for longer has a much different meaning,\u201d said Brusuelas.", "In a statement to CNN, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt argued, without evidence, that President Joe Biden \u201callowed\u201d undocumented immigrants to \u201cinvade our border\u201d and that if he\u2019s reelected they will be allowed to stay.", "\u201cMedicare, Social Security, the healthcare system, public safety and American democracy itself will buckle and collapse,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cWhen President\u00a0Trump\u00a0is back in the White House, he will deport the millions of illegal immigrants Joe Biden let in and reimplement his America First, pro-growth, pro-job agenda to uplift all Americans.\u201d", "Inflation remains a major concern for Americans.", "Even though consumer prices are no longer skyrocketing, the cumulative impact of three years of high inflation is painful. Americans are paying much more for housing, food and car insurance than they were before Covid-19.", "Frustrations with the high cost of living helped drive down consumer sentiment to a six-month low, the University of Michigan survey of consumers found on Friday.", "\u201cMost Americans view high inflation and high prices as unfair. It\u2019s a rip-off. How is it possible I\u2019m paying more for something \u2013 a lot more for something \u2013 today than three years ago?\u201d said Zandi.", "Anger over inflation could help return Trump to the White House. And yet, ironically, economists warn that his immigration plan \u2013 and his vow to impose massive tariffs on China and other nations \u2013 could worsen that same inflation problem.", "\u201cMy sense is President Trump\u2019s policies are inflationary,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt\u2019s higher tariffs, it\u2019s more deportations. \u2026 I think these things are going to lead to higher prices for American consumers.\u201d", "Some businesses continue to face a shortage of workers. Although the number of job openings has tumbled in recent months, it remains well above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Labor Department.", "Of course, it\u2019s hard to know whether Trump would carry through on his immigration proposals. After all, he promised mass deportations in 2016, too. And Trump\u2019s immigration plans would surely face serious legal challenges.", "But immigration remains a major concern for voters in the 2024 election and Trump has made it a centerpiece of his campaign.", "The spike in immigration over the last several years has caused a severe strain on resources in some cities and states as officials scramble to house, educate and feed asylum seekers.", "And the flow of migrants, along with a series of high-profile criminal cases involving migrants, have contributed to concerns about crime \u2014 though criminologists are skeptical about the connection.", "Even the Biden administration has tried to take a tougher position on immigration. Last week, US officials proposed a rule that would let immigration authorities rapidly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum.", "Yet economists say the immigration spike has also played a major role in one of the big positive surprises of the past few years: America\u2019s ability to defy recession forecasts.", "To the shock of many forecasters, the post-Covid labor market has not run out of workers. Jobs growth continues at a pace few thought possible. And the unemployment rate has stayed under 4% for 27 months in a row, matching the record streak from 1967 to 1970.", "Economists say the recent spike in immigration helped make these surprises possible, by preventing the jobs market from totally overheating and the Fed from overdoing rate hikes.", "\u201cIt helped to ease the very tight labor market, bring in some of those wage pressures and reduce inflation,\u201d said Zandi. \u201cIt also allowed the economy to grow more quickly.\u201d", "Prior to Covid-19, population and labor force projections from the federal government suggested the US economy would only be able to sustainably add (without worsening inflation) between 60,000 and 140,000 jobs per month and then between 60,000 and 100,000 per month by 2024, according to research from The Hamilton Project.", "In reality, the US economy added an average of 255,000 jobs per month in 2023 \u2014 two to four times the pace considered sustainable, research notes.", "\u201cJust in the last year, a big part of the story of the labor market coming back into better balance is immigration returning to levels that were more typical of the pre-pandemic era,\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in February.", "The Hamilton Project paper estimates sustainable employment growth will be between 160,000 and 200,000 per month in 2024 \u2014 about double what would have been possible before the immigration surge.", "Without that influx of workers, the US economy could have faced a different fate.", "\u201cThe Fed would have likely overdone it with rates and tipped the economy into recession,\u201d said Brusuelas, the RSM economist.", "Immigration collapsed when the Covid-19 pandemic began in early 2020, contributing to the historic shortage of workers that drove up wages.", "But then immigration rebounded massively in 2022 and 2023, in part because of a surge of migrants.", "US authorities had more than 2.5 million encounters with migrants crossing the US-Mexico border last year alone, according to Homeland Security estimates.", "In 2023, the United States experienced net immigration of about 3.3 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That well exceeds the average of just 900,000 that was typical between 2010 and 2019.", "The immigration spike has been so significant that the CBO estimates the United States is on track to have 1.7 million more people in its pool of workers this year compared with what was expected last year.", "Goldman Sachs economists estimate that the immigration surge eased wage growth by 0.3 percentage points at the national level and by at least twice as much in the low-paying leisure and hospitality sector.", "Although the \u201ctextbook answer\u201d is that immigration should not matter much for wages and inflation, Goldman Sachs economists recently told clients: \u201cWe think this time was a bit different.\u201d", "\u201cThe main reasons are that the immigration turnaround was very large and that it occurred at a time when the labor market was historically overheated,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists wrote.", "Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs said \u201cmoderate fluctuations\u201d in immigration will probably have \u201clittle impact\u201d on wage growth and inflation. The exception, the bank said, would be in the event of \u201cdramatic policy changes.\u201d", "Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project and senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told CNN she is \u201cconfident\u201d an immigration crackdown like the one Trump proposes would have \u201cnegative\u201d effects on the economy.", "However, Edelberg is less concerned about the inflationary impact and more worried about a crash in demand \u2014 especially in communities that have experienced a large influx of immigrants.", "She noted that some businesses have enjoyed a sharp increase in demand in recent years in large part because of immigrants.", "\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that could spark a recession,\u201d Edelberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to suggest this would be a cataclysmic recession, but this would be a very abrupt reduction in aggregate demand. Generally, that\u2019s not the kind of thing that our economy likes.\u201d", "CNN\u2019s Elisabeth Buchwald contributed to this report.", "Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump visited two different Texas border cities on Thursday in dueling trips that put immigration squarely at the center of their near-certain rematch in this year\u2019s presidential election. The visits came on the heels of a bipartisan immigration bill failing in the U.S. Senate after Trump told Republicans not to vote for it, in part so that he could campaign on the issue. The bill proposed overhauling the nation's asylum system to provide quicker answers to migrants and allow presidents to order immediate deportation of migrants at the border when immigration agents get overwhelmed. Biden didn't announce any new immigration policy in Brownsville on Thursday, but made a push for Congress to approve the bipartisan immigration bill. He was accompanied by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas; U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen; and Brownsville Mayor John Cowen. \"The majority of Democrats and Republicans in both houses support this legislation,\" Biden said during a speech at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection station. \"Until someone came along and said don't do that that'll benefit the incumbent. That's a hell of a way to do business in America for such a serious problem.\" Meanwhile in Eagle Pass, Trump, who was joined by Gov. Greg Abbott at Shelby Park, repeatedly criticized Biden's handling of immigration, saying the \"United States is being overrun by the Biden migrant crime.\" Trump specifically mentioned Laken Riley, a 22-year-old Augusta University nursing student whose body was found in Georgia last week. Riley\u2019s death was thrust into the national spotlight when police disclosed that the man charged with the killing was a Venezuelan immigrant, and Trump suggested the Biden administration was culpable. The Marshall Project recently reported that there has not been an increase in reported crime in cities where migrants have moved to. Trump also praised Abbott\u2019s deployment of concertina wire along the Rio Grande and efforts to arrest migrants who cross the border illegally. \"He really stepped it up,\" Trump said. \"It's been amazing.\" The two candidates' visits came the same day a federal judge blocked a new state law that sought to allow Texas police to arrest people suspected of crossing the border illegally and judges to order them to return to Mexico. In the recent past, Brownsville has experienced high numbers of migrants crossing into the country. Large migrant encampments have been a frequent sight on the other side of the border in Matamoros, Mexico. Eagle Pass has recently served as the epicenter of immigration enforcement efforts by Texas officials, who have been locked in a tense standoff with the federal government. In December, that town also experienced thousands of migrants crossing the Rio Grande. Abbott on Thursday accused Biden of only traveling to the Texas-Mexico border after it was announced that Trump would be appearing in Eagle Pass. Biden, meanwhile, also called out Trump \u2014 and asked him to push Congress to pass significant immigration legislation. \"Here's what I would say to Mr. Trump instead of playing politics with this issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me, or I'll join you, in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.\" Trump has said that immigration enforcement will be among his priorities if he wins back the presidency in November. During his presidency, his administration rolled out a series of policies aimed to prevent people from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and deter migrants from crossing the border illegally. His policies included the emergency health order known as Title 42, which immigration officials used to immediately turn away people at the border without allowing them to request asylum; the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program that forced some migrants with pending asylum cases to wait in Mexico before their cases were adjudicated; and a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d to criminally charge adults who illegally crossed the border, which required Border Patrol agents to separate children from their parents. The federal government also built 55 miles of new barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border after Trump promised in campaign rallies to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall.\u201d The Biden administration slowly reversed some of Trump\u2019s policies, such as the use of Title 42, and scrapped the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program. It also created and expanded programs that help some immigrants to enter the country legally. For example, last year it announced a program that allows 30,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to legally migrate to the U.S. each month, as long as they have a financial sponsor in the U.S. It also expanded a 2014 program that allows children in Central America to legally reunite with family members already in the U.S. Trump and other Republican leaders have characterized Biden\u2019s actions on immigration as open-border policies \u2014 that\u2019s a frequent refrain by Gov. Greg Abbott, who picked up where Trump left off and has flooded the border with state troopers, National Guard and spent state money to build barriers and deploy concertina wire. The Biden administration has angered some of its supporters by implementing policies that also make it more challenging for migrants to enter the U.S. legally. In early 2023, the Biden administration began requiring asylum-seekers to use the CBP One cellphone application to seek one of 1,400 daily appointments to request asylum at a port of entry. The administration also implemented a rule last year that disqualifies migrants from receiving asylum if they entered the country illegally (Under U.S. law, migrants have a right to apply for asylum regardless of how they enter the country.) \u201cIn fact, virtually every measure of border enforcement currently is, or has at various points been, at a level that is higher than when Biden came into office \u2014 often higher than at any point under the Trump administration,\u201d David J. Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based libertarian think tank, wrote in a recent report.

In December, that town also experienced thousands of migrants crossing the Rio Grande.", "Abbott on Thursday accused Biden of only traveling to the Texas-Mexico border after it was announced that Trump would be appearing in Eagle Pass.", "Biden, meanwhile, also called out Trump \u2014 and asked him to push Congress to pass significant immigration legislation.", "\"Here's what I would say to Mr. Trump instead of playing politics with this issue, instead of telling members of Congress to block this legislation, join me, or I'll join you, in telling the Congress to pass this bipartisan border security bill. We can do it together.\"", "Trump has said that immigration enforcement will be among his priorities if he wins back the presidency in November. During his presidency, his administration rolled out a series of policies aimed to prevent people from seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and deter migrants from crossing the border illegally.", "His policies included the emergency health order known as Title 42, which immigration officials used to immediately turn away people at the border without allowing them to request asylum; the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program that forced some migrants with pending asylum cases to wait in Mexico before their cases were adjudicated; and a \u201czero tolerance policy\u201d to criminally charge adults who illegally crossed the border, which required Border Patrol agents to separate children from their parents.", "The federal government also built 55 miles of new barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border after Trump promised in campaign rallies to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall.\u201d", "The Biden administration slowly reversed some of Trump\u2019s policies, such as the use of Title 42, and scrapped the \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d program. It also created and expanded programs that help some immigrants to enter the country legally. For example, last year it announced a program that allows 30,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to legally migrate to the U.S. each month, as long as they have a financial sponsor in the U.S. It also expanded a 2014 program that allows children in Central America to legally reunite with family members already in the U.S.", "Trump and other Republican leaders have characterized Biden\u2019s actions on immigration as open-border policies \u2014 that\u2019s a frequent refrain by Gov. Greg Abbott, who picked up where Trump left off and has flooded the border with state troopers, National Guard and spent state money to build barriers and deploy concertina wire.", "The Biden administration has angered some of its supporters by implementing policies that also make it more challenging for migrants to enter the U.S. legally.", "In early 2023, the Biden administration began requiring asylum-seekers to use the CBP One cellphone application to seek one of 1,400 daily appointments to request asylum at a port of entry. The administration also implemented a rule last year that disqualifies migrants from receiving asylum if they entered the country illegally (Under U.S. law, migrants have a right to apply for asylum regardless of how they enter the country.)", "\u201cIn fact, virtually every measure of border enforcement currently is, or has at various points been, at a level that is higher than when Biden came into office \u2014 often higher than at any point under the Trump administration,\u201d David J. Bier, associate director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a Washington-based libertarian think tank, wrote in a recent report.", "We can\u2019t wait to welcome you to downtown Austin Sept. 5-7 for the 2024 Texas Tribune Festival!

(Win McNamee/Getty Images) WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Donald Trump in his second term would carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants by utilizing local law enforcement, the National Guard and potentially the U.S. military, according to a lengthy interview he conducted with Time magazine. \u201cWhen we talk military, generally speaking, I talk National Guard,\u201d the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee for president said in an interview that published Tuesday. Trump has vowed that on his first day in office, he plans to roll out a massive deportation effort reminiscent of an immigration crackdown that took place in the 1950s. \u201cI would have no problem using the military, per se,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have law and order in our country. And whichever gets us there, but I think the National Guard will do the job.\u201d The interviewer, Time magazine national politics reporter Eric Cortellessa, asked how Trump could justify using the military, given the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that removed the military from civil law enforcement. \u201cWell, these aren\u2019t civilians,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cThese are people that aren\u2019t legally in our country.\u201d Trump fined $9,000 for violating gag order in NY hush-money trial  The Biden campaign put out a statement following the interview that slammed Trump\u2019s comments, arguing his responses would reflect an authoritarian second term, and calling him a \u201cdictator.\u201d \u201cIn his own words, he is promising to rule as a dictator on \u2018day one,\u2019 use the military against the American people, punish those who stand against him, condone violence done on his behalf, and put his own revenge and retribution ahead of what is best for America,\u201d James Singer, a spokesperson for the Biden campaign said in a statement. \u201cTrump is a danger to the Constitution and a threat to our democracy.\u201d The campaign made no rebuttal in that statement of Trump\u2019s remarks about deportation. Trump cited using the National Guard in Minneapolis in 2020. However, it was not Trump but Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz who activated the National Guard in response to massive protests after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd. Floyd, a Black man, died when Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes. Chauvin was convicted of murder in 2022. \u201cWe will be using local law enforcement,\u201d Trump said, adding that he wants special immunity for police from prosecution. \u201cAnd we have to give the police back the power and respect that they deserve,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, there will be some mistakes, and there are certain bad people and that\u2019s a terrible thing. And you know, police are being prosecuted all the time. And we want to give them immunity from prosecution if they\u2019re doing their job.\u201d Trump said he would create funding incentives for local and state police departments to take part in deportations. \u201cWell, there\u2019s a possibility that some won\u2019t want to participate, and they won\u2019t partake in the riches, you know,\u201d Trump said. He\u2019s likely to face pushback from Democratic-led states and municipalities, as well as legal challenges. Trump leaves door open to banning medication abortion nationwide  Trump did not go into detail about how much money he would request from Congress for his deportation plans. The control of Congress, now split between Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate, also could shift after this fall\u2019s elections. Trump added that he would not rule out building mass detention centers to carry out mass deportations. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll do it to an extent, but we shouldn\u2019t have to do very much of it, because we\u2019re going to be moving them out as soon as we get to it,\u201d Trump said. Those policies are likely to face legal challenges, and Trump said he would follow any ruling from the Supreme Court, where he picked three of the nine justices, solidifying a conservative court for decades. \u201cI have great respect for the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. Even though Trump also promised mass deportations in his first term, those first four years had fewer deportations than the first term of the Obama administration. In the first four years of the Obama administration, there were more than 1.5 million non-citizens deported and the first Trump administration deported more than 1.2 million non-citizens, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration authorized the public health tool Title 42 and expelled more than 2 million migrants from claiming asylum. by Ariana Figueroa, Louisiana Illuminator April 30, 2024 by Ariana Figueroa, Louisiana Illuminator April 30, 2024 WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Donald Trump in his second term would carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants by utilizing local law enforcement, the National Guard and potentially the U.S. military, according to a lengthy interview he conducted with Time magazine. \u201cWhen we talk military, generally speaking, I talk National Guard,\u201d the presumptive 2024 GOP nominee for president said in an interview that published Tuesday.

Trump is known for his reactionary politics that impact working-class people. During his presidential tenure, the Trump administration enacted 472 administrative changes to dismantle and reconstruct the U.S. immigration system, increasing barriers to legal immigration and diminishing humanitarian protections.

During his presidential term, Trump put forward three Supreme Court justices with conservative political leanings, the last being Amy Coney Barret, who was instrumental in the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade. MNAAC was formed in direct response to this Supreme Court case. Since then, MNAAC has been campaigning around crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), which are fake abortion clinics funded by right-wing Christian evangelical organizations. Jeff Giering, another organizer with MNAAC, told the crowd, \u201cI believe the rights to life, to personal liberty, and to reproductive choice are under attack by Republicans nationwide. They are under attack by Donald Trump.'' Giering continued on to pinpoint the connections between the Republican and Democratic parties, noting capitalism as breeding grounds for creating opportunistic politicians who only value human life as long as it\u2019s profitable.

In some ways, Trump, the front-runner to secure the Republican presidential nomination, is relying on the same hardline immigration playbook he used during his 2016 campaign. He has pledged to build miles of more border wall and impose dramatic limits on asylum, including by reviving a program his administration used to require migrants to await their asylum hearings in Mexico. But in other ways, Trump's promises and rhetoric on immigration during his second presidential campaign have been harsher this time around. He has vowed to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants living in the country unlawfully, deputize the National Guard to carry out mass deportations and deny entry to legal immigrants based on their ideological beliefs. In one recent interview, Trump suggested that some migrants were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" While they would mark a stark departure from current policy, many of Trump's immigration pledges would face formidable legal and operational challenges, testing the limits of presidential authority and government resources. Angela Kelley, a former top Biden administration immigration official, called Trump's pledges \"extreme\" proposals that would \"terrorize\" immigrants. \"The radical ideas that he had in his first term, from the Muslim ban and beyond, a lot of those got struck down. And now he's just taking another swing,\" said Kelley, now a chief adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. But Chad Wolf, who led the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's final year in office, said officials who ignore the record levels of unlawful crossings along the southern border over the past two years are the ones with the \"extreme\" position. He said Americans want more aggressive actions to deal with the crisis there, including by deporting the estimated 1 million people who have been issued final deportation orders. \"If you go after those individuals and the criminals, of course, and others, I don't think that that's out of the norm. I don't think that that's a radical suggestion,\" said Wolf, who now works for the America First Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes Trump's agenda. \"I think that is actually just implementing what the immigration law tells the executive to do.\" Trump has promised to carry out the \"largest deportation operation\" in U.S. history, modeled after the Eisenhower administration's infamous \"Operation Wetback\" in 1954, when hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants and American citizens were deported. To facilitate the mass deportations, Trump has said he will give the National Guard and state officials the authority to arrest and deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, a move that would challenge long-standing legal limits on the military engaging in domestic law enforcement. He has also pledged to invoke the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 \u2014 a law cited during World War II to approve the surveillance and detention of Italian, German and Japanese immigrants \u2014 to deport suspected migrant gang members. Trump has vowed to issue an executive order on his first day back at the White House that would attempt to deny birthright citizenship to children with parents who are not American citizens or permanent residents. Under a decades-old interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, children born on U.S. soil are automatically bestowed American citizenship, even if their parents are not in the country legally. The former president has said he would direct immigration officers to deny entry to \"Marxists\" and \"communists,\" though he has not shared details on how such vetting would be implemented. He also committed to halting refugee admissions from the Middle East and expanding the travel ban his administration issued to bar the entry of citizens from certain countries, most of them majority Muslim or African. At the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump has promised to reinstate the policies to disqualify most migrants from asylum and expedite their deportation. They include the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, agreements that allow the U.S. to reroute asylum-seekers to third countries and broad restrictions on asylum eligibility. Trump has also said he would revive the Title 42 pandemic-era policy that U.S. border officials cited to expel migrants on public health grounds, including unaccompanied children. He has not ruled out separating migrant children from their parents, a practice he discontinued in 2018 due to public outcry. If Trump is elected president a second time, his campaign pledges would surely receive the same legal pushback from Democratic-led states and civil rights organizations that his policies attracted during his first stint at the White House. He would also face the reality of an understaffed and overwhelmed immigration system that Congress has not updated since the 1990s. Trump's promise to end birthright citizenship, for example, is legally questionable. Most legal scholars believe it is a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, which says \"persons born or naturalized in the United States\" are \"citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" Changing the Constitution must be proposed by a supermajority in Congress or a constitutional convention held by two-thirds of all states. It would then have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. The vow to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history would face potentially insurmountable operational barriers. The deportation branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example, has around 8,000 employees. The agency also does not have the funds to carry out the massive roundups and deportations Trump has previewed. The largest annual ICE deportation tally was recorded in 2012, when the Obama administration carried out over 400,000 deportations. \"It would require a massive amount of money appropriated by Congress,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University. Yale-Loehr said such an operation would also raise significant legal and humanitarian concerns. U.S. law affords immigrants in deportation proceedings due process, he noted. Many immigrants who could be deportable have U.S. citizen spouses or children, raising the specter of large-scale family separations since the government does not have the legal authority to deport American citizens. \"It would be a significant change,\" Yale-Loehr said of the possibility of Trump's 2024 campaign promises being implemented. \"But there's only so much you can do through executive action. Many of the things he tried before were immediately tied up in litigation, and were ultimately struck down by the courts.\" Despite the legal and operational hurdles they face, Trump's immigration proposals have been embraced by the Republican presidential hopefuls closest to him in the polls. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy have both pledged to carry out mass deportations and end birthright citizenship. Nikki Haley and Tim Scott have also joined Trump and DeSantis is calling for the U.S. to reject Palestinian refugees. And other GOP candidates, including moderate ones like Chris Christie, have promised to reinstate some of Trump's border policies and to build more miles of border wall.

He has pledged to build miles of more border wall and impose dramatic limits on asylum, including by reviving a program his administration used to require migrants to await their asylum hearings in Mexico.", "But in other ways, Trump's promises and rhetoric on immigration during his second presidential campaign have been harsher this time around. He has vowed to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants living in the country unlawfully, deputize the National Guard to carry out mass deportations and deny entry to legal immigrants based on their ideological beliefs. In one recent interview, Trump suggested that some migrants were \"poisoning the blood of our country.\"", "While they would mark a stark departure from current policy, many of Trump's immigration pledges would face formidable legal and operational challenges, testing the limits of presidential authority and government resources.", "Angela Kelley, a former top Biden administration immigration official, called Trump's pledges \"extreme\" proposals that would \"terrorize\" immigrants. \"The radical ideas that he had in his first term, from the Muslim ban and beyond, a lot of those got struck down. And now he's just taking another swing,\" said Kelley, now a chief adviser at the American Immigration Lawyers Association.", "But Chad Wolf, who led the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's final year in office, said officials who ignore the record levels of unlawful crossings along the southern border over the past two years are the ones with the \"extreme\" position. He said Americans want more aggressive actions to deal with the crisis there, including by deporting the estimated 1 million people who have been issued final deportation orders.", "\"If you go after those individuals and the criminals, of course, and others, I don't think that that's out of the norm. I don't think that that's a radical suggestion,\" said Wolf, who now works for the America First Policy Institute, a think tank that promotes Trump's agenda. \"I think that is actually just implementing what the immigration law tells the executive to do.\"", "Trump has promised to carry out the \"largest deportation operation\" in U.S. history, modeled after the Eisenhower administration's infamous \"Operation Wetback\" in 1954, when hundreds of thousands of Mexican immigrants and American citizens were deported.", "To facilitate the mass deportations, Trump has said he will give the National Guard and state officials the authority to arrest and deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, a move that would challenge long-standing legal limits on the military engaging in domestic law enforcement. He has also pledged to invoke the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 \u2014 a law cited during World War II to approve the surveillance and detention of Italian, German and Japanese immigrants \u2014 to deport suspected migrant gang members.", "Trump has vowed to issue an executive order on his first day back at the White House that would attempt to deny birthright citizenship to children with parents who are not American citizens or permanent residents. Under a decades-old interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, children born on U.S. soil are automatically bestowed American citizenship, even if their parents are not in the country legally.", "The former president has said he would direct immigration officers to deny entry to \"Marxists\" and \"communists,\" though he has not shared details on how such vetting would be implemented. He also committed to halting refugee admissions from the Middle East and expanding the travel ban his administration issued to bar the entry of citizens from certain countries, most of them majority Muslim or African.", "At the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump has promised to reinstate the policies to disqualify most migrants from asylum and expedite their deportation. They include the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, agreements that allow the U.S. to reroute asylum-seekers to third countries and broad restrictions on asylum eligibility.", "Trump has also said he would revive the Title 42 pandemic-era policy that U.S. border officials cited to expel migrants on public health grounds, including unaccompanied children. He has not ruled out separating migrant children from their parents, a practice he discontinued in 2018 due to public outcry.", "If Trump is elected president a second time, his campaign pledges would surely receive the same legal pushback from Democratic-led states and civil rights organizations that his policies attracted during his first stint at the White House. He would also face the reality of an understaffed and overwhelmed immigration system that Congress has not updated since the 1990s.", "Trump's promise to end birthright citizenship, for example, is legally questionable. Most legal scholars believe it is a right enshrined in the 14th Amendment, which says \"persons born or naturalized in the United States\" are \"citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"", "Changing the Constitution must be proposed by a supermajority in Congress or a constitutional convention held by two-thirds of all states. It would then have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states.", "The vow to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history would face potentially insurmountable operational barriers. The deportation branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example, has around 8,000 employees. The agency also does not have the funds to carry out the massive roundups and deportations Trump has previewed. The largest annual ICE deportation tally was recorded in 2012, when the Obama administration carried out over 400,000 deportations.", "\"It would require a massive amount of money appropriated by Congress,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University.", "Yale-Loehr said such an operation would also raise significant legal and humanitarian concerns.

Republicans blame the record levels of illegal immigration on President Biden softening U.S. border security and reversing Trump policies they say had been effective at decreasing flows. Democrats, who describe former President Donald Trump\u2019s policies as inhumane, say the GOP is inflating both the numbers and the blame \u2013 and ignoring the impact of a rise in forced global migration. Immigration is a top issue in the U.S. presidential race amid questions about the pace of illegal border crossings and candidate track records. Here\u2019s what the available data tells us. A\u00a0report\u00a0last month from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute says \u201cthe rapid increase in arrivals in recent years reflects ongoing crises in the Americas,\u201d and instability elsewhere in the world. Other reasons cited include a strong U.S. economy, sophisticated smuggling networks, and the perception that the Biden administration\u2019s policies are more welcoming. Overall, illegal crossings have increased significantly during the Biden administration, but some Republicans are overestimating the net influx of unauthorized migrants. Immigration ranks in several major polls as the No. 1 national concern for voters leading into this year\u2019s U.S. presidential election. That amplifies the question, how does the rate of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden compare with that under his predecessor and likely opponent, Donald Trump? Republicans blame the record levels of illegal immigration on President Biden softening U.S. border security and reversing Trump policies they say had been effective at decreasing flows. Democrats, who describe former President Trump\u2019s policies as inhumane, say the GOP is inflating both the numbers and the blame \u2013 and ignoring the impact of a rise in forced global migration. A March report from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute says that \u201cthe rapid increase in arrivals in recent years reflects ongoing crises in the Americas\u201d and instability elsewhere in the world. Other reasons cited include a strong U.S. economy, sophisticated smuggling networks, and the perception that the Biden administration\u2019s policies are more welcoming. Immigration is a top issue in the U.S. presidential race amid questions about the pace of illegal border crossings and candidate track records. Here\u2019s what the available data tells us. Republicans focus on another explanation. They say Mr. Biden has taken 64 actions, including revoking numerous Trump policies, that have incentivized illegal immigration and undermined border security. Here we examine the available data, as well as key immigration and border policies under each presidency. Q:\u00a0How do the Trump and Biden levels of illegal immigration compare? The U.S. government does not publish data on the net number of migrants who enter illegally and remain in the country. The main metric U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracks is how many \u201cencounters\u201d there are between its agents and migrants seeking to cross illegally. (This is a measure of individuals encountered, so if Border Patrol encounters a group of 10 migrants, that counts as 10 encounters.) Under the Biden administration, there have been 6.4 million encounters outside official ports of entry along the southern border so far, with the yearly average more than quadruple that of the Trump administration, according to a Monitor analysis of CBP data. In addition, CBP agents have registered more than 1.6 million encounters at official ports of entry with migrants deemed \u201cinadmissible,\u201d some of whom are allowed to temporarily enter the country. Border Patrol also tracks \u201cgotaways,\u201d migrants seen crossing by border agents who are too occupied to respond, or picked up by cameras and sensors. Those totaled nearly 400,000 for the most recent fiscal year reported, 2021, which is more than double the highest annual total during the Trump administration. There is also an unquantifiable number of undetected gotaways. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Some Republicans claim that Mr. Biden has let in as many as 8 million or 9 million migrants. However, it\u2019s not accurate to simply add up encounters and gotaways as a proxy for illegal immigration. One reason is that since the pandemic, more migrants have tried multiple times to enter, inflating the number of encounters. Also, many of the encountered migrants aren\u2019t permitted to stay in the country. Others gain legal status. Hundreds of thousands have claimed asylum and been allowed to remain while their cases are pending. Furthermore, migrants arriving at ports of entry are often participating in humanitarian parole programs, which the Biden administration expanded and considers a method of legal immigration. A federal judge upheld one such parole program in March. Some groups have tried to gauge the net number of people who cross into the United States illegally and remain in the country, despite lack of government data. Last year, the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter border control, gave a preliminary estimate that the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. rose by 2.4 million (to 12.6 million total) in the first 27 months of the Biden presidency. Recent research by investment bank Goldman Sachs said the rise in unauthorized immigration was a key factor in driving net immigration to its highest level in two decades last year. The Migration Policy Institute, meanwhile, estimated the 2021 unauthorized immigrant population at 11.2 million and noted \u201clarger annual growth than at any point since 2015.\u201d The institute indicated that while that could increase the overall population of unauthorized immigrants, the net change depends on numerous factors, including emigration rates. Overall, illegal crossings have increased significantly during the Biden administration, but some Republicans are overestimating the net influx of unauthorized migrants. USAFacts, Pew Research Center Q:\u00a0How have asylum policies changed under each administration? Mr. Trump significantly limited the ability of migrants to claim asylum, or protection in the U.S. due to persecution or a credible fear of persecution in their home countries. Under the Trump administration, migrants were deemed ineligible for asylum if, after leaving their home countries, they had traveled through one other country or more before reaching the U.S. without applying for asylum in at least one. The Biden administration has kept a portion of that ban intact, but only for migrants who enter outside official ports of entry. It now allows asylum-seekers \u2013 regardless of whether they have applied in third countries \u2013 to make an appointment at a U.S. port of entry through the expanded use of a CBP phone app. Another key difference is that Mr. Trump also required some asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico instead of the U.S. while their cases were pending, a policy that the Biden administration ended in 2022. The number of people granted asylum per year dipped during Mr. Biden\u2019s first year in office, after the global pandemic shutdown, but then more than doubled in his second year. While the number granted asylum is not yet available for 2023, the number of asylum applications U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services received that year was nearly double a record high from the year before, compounding court backlogs. Q:\u00a0What is immigration \u201cparole,\u201d and how have Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump used it? The Immigration and Nationality Act has for decades granted presidential administrations discretion to temporarily allow entry to noncitizens via parole \u201conly on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\u201d Senate Republicans say President Biden has abused that provision to welcome immigrants en masse. In January 2023, his administration created a program that allows up to 30,000 total individuals each month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to travel to the U.S. and seek parole. Some 301,000 migrants were paroled at official ports of entry in fiscal 2023; the highest annual total under Mr. Trump was 75,000. Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, Syracuse University Parole has traditionally occurred at official ports of entry, including airports. In a significant shift, the Biden administration has also granted parole in between ports of entry, allowing in nearly 290,000 such migrants during the first two years, according to government data compiled by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research center at Syracuse University. Q:\u00a0What makes it difficult to tally the current number of unauthorized immigrants? The most obvious reason is that Border Patrol doesn\u2019t catch or even see every migrant who crosses illegally. Second, many unauthorized immigrants came to the U.S. legally but overstayed their visa or other provision for legal residence. Third, people flow out of the U.S. as well as in, with emigration fueled by migrants\u2019 decisions to return to countries of origin or by enforcement policies. Fourth, while the U.S. government publishes the number of encounters, it does not specify how many unique individuals are encountered, or how many of those encountered are allowed to remain in the country, making it impossible to calculate the precise scope of net illegal immigration.

Under the pandemic-era rule known as Title 42, in place until May 2023, Border Patrol agents could expel migrants on public health grounds. But migrants could try again without penalty, driving a fourfold increase in people trying to enter the U.S. illegally more than once per fiscal year. The rate rose to 27% in 2021, from 7% in 2019. Bottom line: While we don\u2019t know exactly how many unauthorized immigrants are added to the U.S. population each year, an array of different metrics signals a significant increase under Mr. Biden.

Dear Reader, About a year ago, I happened upon this statement about the Monitor in the Harvard Business Review \u2013 under the charming heading of \u201cdo things that don\u2019t interest you\u201d: \u201cMany things that end up\u201d being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, \u201chave come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things \u2018boring\u2019 simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.\u201d If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We\u2019re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We\u2019re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I\u2019m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that\u2019s hard for the world to figure out. We\u2019re run by a church, but we\u2019re not only for church members and we\u2019re not about converting people. We\u2019re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper\u2019s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We\u2019re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, \u201cYou are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15.

That amplifies the question, how does the rate of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden compare with that under his predecessor and likely opponent, Donald Trump?", "Republicans blame the record levels of illegal immigration on President Biden softening U.S. border security and reversing Trump policies they say had been effective at decreasing flows. Democrats, who describe former President Trump\u2019s policies as inhumane, say the GOP is inflating both the numbers and the blame \u2013 and ignoring the impact of a rise in forced global migration.", "A March report from the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute says that \u201cthe rapid increase in arrivals in recent years reflects ongoing crises in the Americas\u201d and instability elsewhere in the world.

Here\u2019s what the available data tells us.", "Republicans focus on another explanation. They say Mr. Biden has taken 64 actions, including revoking numerous Trump policies, that have incentivized illegal immigration and undermined border security.", "Here we examine the available data, as well as key immigration and border policies under each presidency.", "Q:\u00a0How do the Trump and Biden levels of illegal immigration compare?", "The U.S. government does not publish data on the net number of migrants who enter illegally and remain in the country. The main metric U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracks is how many \u201cencounters\u201d there are between its agents and migrants seeking to cross illegally. (This is a measure of individuals encountered, so if Border Patrol encounters a group of 10 migrants, that counts as 10 encounters.)", "Under the Biden administration, there have been 6.4 million encounters outside official ports of entry along the southern border so far, with the yearly average more than quadruple that of the Trump administration, according to a Monitor analysis of CBP data.", "In addition, CBP agents have registered more than 1.6 million encounters at official ports of entry with migrants deemed \u201cinadmissible,\u201d some of whom are allowed to temporarily enter the country.", "Border Patrol also tracks \u201cgotaways,\u201d migrants seen crossing by border agents who are too occupied to respond, or picked up by cameras and sensors. Those totaled nearly 400,000 for the most recent fiscal year reported, 2021, which is more than double the highest annual total during the Trump administration. There is also an unquantifiable number of undetected gotaways.", "U.S. Department of Homeland Security", "Some Republicans claim that Mr. Biden has let in as many as 8 million or 9 million migrants. However, it\u2019s not accurate to simply add up encounters and gotaways as a proxy for illegal immigration.", "One reason is that since the pandemic, more migrants have tried multiple times to enter, inflating the number of encounters. Also, many of the encountered migrants aren\u2019t permitted to stay in the country.", "Others gain legal status. Hundreds of thousands have claimed asylum and been allowed to remain while their cases are pending. Furthermore, migrants arriving at ports of entry are often participating in humanitarian parole programs, which the Biden administration expanded and considers a method of legal immigration. A federal judge upheld one such parole program in March.", "Some groups have tried to gauge the net number of people who cross into the United States illegally and remain in the country, despite lack of government data. Last year, the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter border control, gave a preliminary estimate that the number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. rose by 2.4 million (to 12.6 million total) in the first 27 months of the Biden presidency. Recent research by investment bank Goldman Sachs said the rise in unauthorized immigration was a key factor in driving net immigration to its highest level in two decades last year.", "The Migration Policy Institute, meanwhile, estimated the 2021 unauthorized immigrant population at 11.2 million and noted \u201clarger annual growth than at any point since 2015.\u201d The institute indicated that while that could increase the overall population of unauthorized immigrants, the net change depends on numerous factors, including emigration rates.", "Overall, illegal crossings have increased significantly during the Biden administration, but some Republicans are overestimating the net influx of unauthorized migrants.", "USAFacts, Pew Research Center", "Q:\u00a0How have asylum policies changed under each administration?", "Mr. Trump significantly limited the ability of migrants to claim asylum, or protection in the U.S. due to persecution or a credible fear of persecution in their home countries.", "Under the Trump administration, migrants were deemed ineligible for asylum if, after leaving their home countries, they had traveled through one other country or more before reaching the U.S. without applying for asylum in at least one.", "The Biden administration has kept a portion of that ban intact, but only for migrants who enter outside official ports of entry. It now allows asylum-seekers \u2013 regardless of whether they have applied in third countries \u2013 to make an appointment at a U.S. port of entry through the expanded use of a CBP phone app. Another key difference is that Mr. Trump also required some asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico instead of the U.S. while their cases were pending, a policy that the Biden administration ended in 2022.", "The number of people granted asylum per year dipped during Mr. Biden\u2019s first year in office, after the global pandemic shutdown, but then more than doubled in his second year. While the number granted asylum is not yet available for 2023, the number of asylum applications U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services received that year was nearly double a record high from the year before, compounding court backlogs.", "Q:\u00a0What is immigration \u201cparole,\u201d and how have Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump used it?", "The Immigration and Nationality Act has for decades granted presidential administrations discretion to temporarily allow entry to noncitizens via parole \u201conly on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\u201d", "Senate Republicans say President Biden has abused that provision to welcome immigrants en masse. In January 2023, his administration created a program that allows up to 30,000 total individuals each month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to travel to the U.S. and seek parole.", "Some 301,000 migrants were paroled at official ports of entry in fiscal 2023; the highest annual total under Mr. Trump was 75,000.", "Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, Syracuse University", "Parole has traditionally occurred at official ports of entry, including airports. In a significant shift, the Biden administration has also granted parole in between ports of entry, allowing in nearly 290,000 such migrants during the first two years, according to government data compiled by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research center at Syracuse University.", "Q:\u00a0What makes it difficult to tally the current number of unauthorized immigrants?", "The most obvious reason is that Border Patrol doesn\u2019t catch or even see every migrant who crosses illegally.", "Second, many unauthorized immigrants came to the U.S. legally but overstayed their visa or other provision for legal residence.", "Third, people flow out of the U.S. as well as in, with emigration fueled by migrants\u2019 decisions to return to countries of origin or by enforcement policies.", "Fourth, while the U.S. government publishes the number of encounters, it does not specify how many unique individuals are encountered, or how many of those encountered are allowed to remain in the country, making it impossible to calculate the precise scope of net illegal immigration.", "Deepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.", "Already a subscriber? Log in to hide ads.", "Under the pandemic-era rule known as Title 42, in place until May 2023, Border Patrol agents could expel migrants on public health grounds. But migrants could try again without penalty, driving a fourfold increase in people trying to enter the U.S. illegally more than once per fiscal year. The rate rose to 27% in 2021, from 7% in 2019.", "Bottom line: While we don\u2019t know exactly how many unauthorized immigrants are added to the U.S. population each year, an array of different metrics signals a significant increase under Mr. Biden.", "Already a subscriber?
